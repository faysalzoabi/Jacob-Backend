The smooth functioning of\n              securities markets and public confidence in markets are prerequisites for economic growth and wealth. Market\n              abuse harms the integrity of financial markets and public confidence in securities and derivatives.\n      (3)     Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) completed and updated the Union\u2019s legal\n              framework to protect market integrity. However, given the legislative, market and technological developments since\n              the entry into force of that Directive, which have resulted in considerable changes to the financial landscape, that\n              Directive should now be replaced. A new legislative instrument is also needed to ensure that there are uniform\n              rules and clarity of key concepts and a single rule book in line with the conclusions of the report of 25 February\n              2009 by the High Level Group on Financial Supervision in the EU, chaired by Jacques de Larosi\u00e8re (the \u2018de\n              Larosi\u00e8re Group\u2019).\n      (1) OJ C 161, 7.6.2012, p. 3.\n      (2) OJ C 181, 21.6.2012, p. 64.\n      (3) Position of the European Parliament of 10 September 2013 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and decision of the Council of\n          14 April 2014.\n      (4) Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on insider dealing and market manipulation\n          (market abuse) (OJ L 96, 12.4.2003, p. 16).\n\n\nL 173/2           EN                             Official Journal of the European Union                                      12.6.2014\n     (4)  There is a need to establish a more uniform and stronger framework in order to preserve market integrity, to avoid\n          potential regulatory arbitrage, to ensure accountability in the event of attempted manipulation, and to provide\n          more legal certainty and less regulatory complexity for market participants. This Regulation aims at contributing in\n          a determining manner to the proper functioning of the internal market and should therefore be based on\n          Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), as interpreted consistently in the\n          case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n     (5)  In order to remove the remaining obstacles to trade and the significant distortions of competition resulting from\n          divergences between national laws and to prevent any further obstacles to trade and significant distortions of\n          competition from arising, it is necessary to adopt a Regulation establishing a more uniform interpretation of the\n          Union market abuse framework, which more clearly defines rules applicable in all Member States. Shaping market\n          abuse requirements in the form of a regulation will ensure that those requirements are directly applicable. This\n          should ensure uniform conditions by preventing diverging national requirements as a result of the transposition of\n          a directive. This Regulation will require that all persons follow the same rules in all the Union. It will also reduce\n          regulatory complexity and firms\u2019 compliance costs, especially for firms operating on a cross-border basis, and it\n          will contribute to eliminating distortions of competition.\n     (6)  The Commission Communication of 25 June 2008 on \u2018A \u2018Small Business Act\u2019 for Europe\u2019 calls on the Union and\n          its Member States to design rules in order to reduce administrative burdens, to adapt legislation to the needs of\n          issuers on markets for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and to facilitate access to finance for those\n          issuers. A number of provisions in Directive 2003/6/EC impose administrative burdens on issuers, in particular on\n          those whose financial instruments are admitted to trading on SME growth markets, which should be reduced.\n     (7)  Market abuse is a concept that encompasses unlawful behaviour in the financial markets and, for the purposes of\n          this Regulation, it should be understood to consist of insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information and\n          market manipulation. Such behaviour prevents full and proper market transparency, which is a prerequisite for\n          trading for all economic actors in integrated financial markets.\n     (8)  The scope of Directive 2003/6/EC focused on financial instruments admitted to trading on a regulated market or\n          for which a request for admission to trading on such a market has been made. However, in recent years financial\n          instruments have been increasingly traded on multilateral trading facilities (MTFs). There are also financial\n          instruments which are traded only on other types of organised trading facilities (OTFs) or only over the\n          counter (OTC). The scope of this Regulation should therefore include any financial instrument traded on a\n          regulated market, an MTF or an OTF, and any other conduct or action which can have an effect on such a\n          financial instrument irrespective of whether it takes place on a trading venue. In the case of certain types of MTFs\n          which, like regulated markets, help companies to raise equity finance, the prohibition against market abuse also\n          applies where a request for admission to trading on such a market has been made. The scope of this Regulation\n          should therefore include financial instruments for which an application for admission to trading on an MTF has\n          been made. This should improve investor protection, preserve the integrity of markets and ensure that market\n          abuse of such instruments is clearly prohibited.\n     (9)  For the purposes of transparency, operators of a regulated market, an MTF or an OTF should notify, without delay,\n          their competent authority of details of the financial instruments which they have admitted to trading, for which\n          there has been a request for admission to trading or that have been traded on their trading venue. A second\n          notification should be made when the instrument ceases to be admitted to trading. Such obligations should also\n          apply to financial instruments for which there has been a request for admission to trading on their trading venue\n          and financial instruments that have been admitted to trading prior to the entry into force of this Regulation. The\n          notifications should be submitted to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) by the competent\n          authorities and ESMA should publish a list of all of the financial instruments notified. This Regulation applies to\n          financial instruments whether or not they are included in the list published by ESMA.\n     (10) It is possible that certain financial instruments which are not traded on a trading venue are used for market abuse.\n          This includes financial instruments the price or value of which depends or has an effect on financial instruments\n          traded on a trading venue, or the trading of which has an effect on the price or value of other financial\n\n\n12.6.2014          EN                           Official Journal of the European Union                                          L 173/3\n           instruments traded on a trading venue. Examples of where such instruments can be used for market abuse include\n           inside information relating to a share or bond, which can be used to buy a derivative of that share or bond, or an\n           index the value of which depends on that share or bond. Where a financial instrument is used as a reference price,\n           an OTC-traded derivative can be used to benefit from manipulated prices, or be used to manipulate the price of a\n           financial instrument traded on a trading venue. A further example is the planned issue of a new tranche of\n           securities that do not otherwise fall within the scope of this Regulation, but where trading in those securities could\n           affect the price or value of existing listed securities that fall within the scope of this Regulation. This Regulation\n           also covers the situation where the price or value of an instrument traded on a trading venue depends on an OTC-\n           traded instrument. The same principle should apply to spot commodity contracts the prices of which are based on\n           that of a derivative and to the buying of spot commodity contracts to which financial instruments are referenced.\n      (11) Trading in securities or associated instruments for the stabilisation of securities or trading in own shares in buy-\n           back programmes can be legitimate for economic reasons and should, therefore, in certain circumstances, be\n           exempt from the prohibitions against market abuse provided that the actions are carried out under the necessary\n           transparency, where relevant information regarding the stabilisation or buy-back programme is disclosed.\n      (12) Trading in own shares in buy-back programmes and Stabilising a financial instrument which would not benefit\n           from the exemptions under this Regulation should not of itself be deemed to constitute market abuse.\n      (13) Member States, members of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), ministries and other agencies and\n           special purpose vehicles of one or several Member States, and the Union and certain other public bodies or persons\n           acting on their behalf should not be restricted in carrying out monetary, exchange-rate or public debt management\n           policy insofar as they are undertaken in the public interest and solely in pursuit of those policies. Neither should\n           transactions or orders carried out, or behaviour by, the Union, a special purpose vehicle of one or several Member\n           States, the European Investment Bank, the European Financial Stability Facility, the European Stability Mechanism\n           or an international financial institution established by two or more Member States, be restricted in mobilising\n           funding and providing financial assistance to the benefit of its members. Such an exemption from the scope of this\n           Regulation may, in accordance with this Regulation, be extended to certain public bodies charged with, or inter\u00ad\n           vening in, public debt management and to central banks of third countries. At the same time, the exemptions for\n           monetary, exchange-rate or public debt management policy should not extend to cases where those bodies engage\n           in transactions, orders or behaviour other than in pursuit of those policies or where persons working for those\n           bodies engage in transactions, orders or behaviour on their own account.\n      (14) Reasonable investors base their investment decisions on information already available to them, that is to say, on ex\n           ante available information. Therefore, the question whether, in making an investment decision, a reasonable\n           investor would be likely to take into account a particular piece of information should be appraised on the\n           basis of the ex ante available information. Such an assessment has to take into consideration the anticipated\n           impact of the information in light of the totality of the related issuer\u2019s activity, the reliability of the source of\n           information and any other market variables likely to affect the financial instruments, the related spot commodity\n           contracts, or the auctioned products based on the emission allowances in the given circumstances.\n      (15) Ex post information can be used to check the presumption that the ex ante information was price sensitive, but\n           should not be used to take action against persons who drew reasonable conclusions from ex ante information\n           available to them.\n      (16) Where inside information concerns a process which occurs in stages, each stage of the process as well as the\n           overall process could constitute inside information. An intermediate step in a protracted process may in itself\n           constitute a set of circumstances or an event which exists or where there is a realistic prospect that they will come\n           into existence or occur, on the basis of an overall assessment of the factors existing at the relevant time. However,\n           that notion should not be interpreted as meaning that the magnitude of the effect of that set of circumstances or\n           that event on the prices of the financial instruments concerned must be taken into consideration. An intermediate\n           step should be deemed to be inside information if it, by itself, meets the criteria laid down in this Regulation for\n           inside information.\n\n\nL 173/4               EN                           Official Journal of the European Union                                          12.6.2014\n     (17)    Information which relates to an event or set of circumstances which is an intermediate step in a protracted process\n             may relate, for example, to the state of contract negotiations, terms provisionally agreed in contract negotiations,\n             the possibility of the placement of financial instruments, conditions under which financial instruments will be\n             marketed, provisional terms for the placement of financial instruments, or the consideration of the inclusion of a\n             financial instrument in a major index or the deletion of a financial instrument from such an index.\n     (18)    Legal certainty for market participants should be enhanced through a closer definition of two of the elements\n             essential to the definition of inside information, namely the precise nature of that information and the significance\n             of its potential effect on the prices of the financial instruments, the related spot commodity contracts, or the\n             auctioned products based on the emission allowances. For derivatives which are wholesale energy products,\n             information required to be disclosed in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 of the European\n             Parliament and of the Council (1) should, in particular, be considered as inside information.\n     (19)    This Regulation is not intended to prohibit discussions of a general nature regarding the business and market\n             developments between shareholders and management concerning an issuer. Such relationships are essential for the\n             efficient functioning of markets and should not be prohibited by this Regulation.\n     (20)    Spot markets and related derivative markets are highly interconnected and global, and market abuse may take place\n             across markets as well as across borders which can lead to significant systemic risks. This is true for both insider\n             dealing and market manipulation. In particular, inside information from a spot market can benefit a person trading\n             on a financial market. Inside information in relation to a derivative of a commodity should be defined as\n             information which both meets the general definition of inside information in relation to financial markets and\n             which is required to be made public in accordance with legal or regulatory provisions at the Union or national\n             level, market rules, contracts or customs on the relevant commodity derivative or spot market. Notable examples\n             of such rules include Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 for the energy market and the Joint Organisations Database\n             Initiative (JODI) database for oil. Such information may serve as the basis of market participants\u2019 decisions to enter\n             into commodity derivatives or the related spot commodity contracts and should therefore constitute inside\n             information required to be made public, where it is likely to have a significant effect on the prices of such\n             derivatives or related spot commodity contracts.\n             Moreover, manipulative strategies can also extend across spot and derivatives markets. Trading in financial instru\u00ad\n             ments, including commodity derivatives, can be used to manipulate related spot commodity contracts and spot\n             commodity contracts can be used to manipulate related financial instruments. The prohibition of market manipu\u00ad\n             lation should capture these inter-linkages. However, it is not appropriate or practicable to extend the scope of this\n             Regulation to behaviour that does not involve financial instruments, for example, to trading in spot commodity\n             contracts that only affects the spot market. In the specific case of wholesale energy products, the competent\n             authorities should take into account the specific characteristics of the definitions of Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011\n             when they apply the definitions of inside information, insider dealing and market manipulation under this\n             Regulation to financial instruments related to wholesale energy products.\n     (21)    Pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), the Commission, Member\n             States and other officially designated bodies are, inter alia, responsible for the technical issuance of emission\n             allowances, their free allocation to eligible industry sectors and new entrants and more generally the development\n             and implementation of the Union\u2019s climate policy framework which underpins the supply of emission allowances\n             to compliance buyers of the Union\u2019s emissions trading scheme (EU ETS). In the exercise of those duties, those\n             public bodies can, inter alia, have access to price-sensitive, non-public information and, pursuant to Directive\n             2003/87/EC, may need to perform certain market operations in relation to emission allowances. As a consequence\n             of the classification of emission allowances as financial instruments as part of the review of Directive 2004/39/EC\n             of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), those instruments will also fall within the scope of this\n             Regulation.\n     (1) Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on wholesale energy market\n         integrity and Transparency (OJ L 326, 8.12.2011, p. 1).\n     (2) Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas\n         emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32).\n     (3) Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments\n         amending Council Directives 85/611/EEC and 93/6/EEC and Directive 2000/12/EC and repealing Council Directive 93/22/EEC\n         (OJ L 145, 30.4.2004, p. 1).\n\n\n12.6.2014             EN                            Official Journal of the European Union                                              L 173/5\n              In order to preserve the ability of the Commission, Member States and other officially designated bodies to develop\n              and implement the Union\u2019s climate policy, the activities of those public bodies, insofar as they are undertaken in\n              the public interest and explicitly in pursuit of that policy and concerning emission allowances, should be exempt\n              from the application of this Regulation. Such exemption should not have a negative impact on overall market\n              transparency, as those public bodies have statutory obligations to operate in a way that ensures orderly, fair and\n              non-discriminatory disclosure of, and access to, any new decisions, developments and data that have a price-\n              sensitive nature. Furthermore, safeguards of fair and non-discriminatory disclosure of specific price-sensitive\n              information held by public authorities exist under Directive 2003/87/EC and the implementing measures\n              adopted pursuant thereto. At the same time, the exemption for public bodies acting in pursuit of the Union\u2019s\n              climate policy should not extend to cases in which those public bodies engage in conduct or in transactions which\n              are not in the pursuit of the Union\u2019s climate policy or when persons working for those bodies engage in conduct\n              or in transactions on their own account.\n      (22)    Pursuant to Article 43 TFEU and to the implementation of international agreements concluded under the TFEU,\n              the Commission, Member States and other officially designated bodies are, inter alia, responsible for pursuing the\n              Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). In the exercise of those duties, those\n              public bodies undertake activities and take measures aiming to manage the agricultural markets and fisheries,\n              including those of public intervention, imposing additional, or suspending, import duties. In the light of the scope\n              of this Regulation, certain provisions thereof that apply to spot commodity contracts which have or which are\n              likely to have an effect on financial instruments and financial instruments the value of which depends on the value\n              of spot commodity contracts and which have or which are likely to have an effect on spot commodity contracts, it\n              is necessary to ensure that the activity of the Commission, Member States and other bodies officially designated to\n              pursue the CAP and the CFP, is not restricted. In order to preserve the ability of the Commission, Member States\n              and other officially designated bodies to develop and pursue the CAP and the CFP, their activities, insofar as they\n              are undertaken in the public interest and solely in pursuance of those policies, should be exempted from the\n              application of this Regulation. Such exemption should not have a negative impact on overall market transparency,\n              as those public bodies have statutory obligations to operate in a way that ensures orderly, fair and non-discrimi\u00ad\n              natory disclosure of, and access to, any new decisions, developments and data that have a price-sensitive nature. At\n              the same time, the exemption for public bodies acting in pursuance of the CAP and the CFP should not extend to\n              cases where those public bodies engage in conduct or in transactions which are not in pursuance of the CAP and\n              the CFP or where persons working for those bodies engage in conduct or in transactions on their own account.\n      (23)    The essential characteristic of insider dealing consists in an unfair advantage being obtained from inside\n              information to the detriment of third parties who are unaware of such information and, consequently, the\n              undermining of the integrity of financial markets and investor confidence. Consequently, the prohibition against\n              insider dealing should apply where a person who is in possession of inside information takes unfair advantage of\n              the benefit gained from that information by entering into market transactions in accordance with that information\n              by acquiring or disposing of, by attempting to acquire or dispose of, by cancelling or amending, or by attempting\n              to cancel or amend, an order to acquire or dispose of, for his own account or for the account of a third party,\n              directly or indirectly, financial instruments to which that information relates. Use of inside information can also\n              consist of trading in emission allowances and derivatives thereof and of bidding in the auctions of emission\n              allowances or other auctioned products based thereon that are held pursuant to Commission Regulation (EU)\n              No 1031/2010 (1).\n      (24)    Where a legal or natural person in possession of inside information acquires or disposes of, or attempts to acquire\n              or dispose of, for his own account or for the account of a third party, directly or indirectly, financial instruments\n              to which that information relates, it should be implied that that person has used that information. That\n              presumption is without prejudice to the rights of the defence. The question whether a person has infringed the\n              prohibition on insider dealing or has attempted to commit insider dealing should be analysed in the light of the\n              purpose of this Regulation, which is to protect the integrity of the financial market and to enhance investor\n              confidence, which is based, in turn, on the assurance that investors will be placed on an equal footing and\n              protected from the misuse of inside information.\n      (1) Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 of 12 November 2010 on the timing, administration and other aspects of auctioning of\n          greenhouse gas emission allowances pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a\n          scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowances trading within the Community (OJ L 302, 18.11.2010, p. 1).\n\n\nL 173/6               EN                          Official Journal of the European Union                                       12.6.2014\n     (25)    Orders placed before a person possesses inside information should not be deemed to be insider dealing. However,\n             where a person comes into possession of inside information, there should be a presumption that any subsequent\n             change relating that information to orders placed before possession of such information, including the cancellation\n             or amendment of an order, or an attempt to cancel or amend an order, constitutes insider dealing. That\n             presumption could, however, be rebutted if the person establishes that he or she did not use the inside information\n             when carrying out the transaction.\n     (26)    Use of inside information can consist of the acquisition or disposal of a financial instrument, or an auctioned\n             product based on emission allowances, of the cancellation or amendment of an order, or the attempt to acquire or\n             dispose of a financial instrument or to cancel or amend an order, by a person who knows, or ought to have\n             known, that the information constitutes inside information. In this respect, the competent authorities should\n             consider what a normal and reasonable person knows or should have known in the circumstances.\n     (27)    This Regulation should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the measures adopted by the Member States to\n             protect the interests of holders of transferable securities carrying voting rights in a company (or which may carry\n             such rights as a consequence of the exercise of rights or conversion) where the company is subject to a public\n             take-over bid or any other proposed change of control. In particular this Regulation should be interpreted in a\n             manner consistent with the laws, regulations and administrative provisions adopted in relation to takeover bids,\n             merger transactions and other transactions affecting ownership or control of companies regulated by the super\u00ad\n             visory authorities appointed by Member States pursuant to Article 4 of Directive 2004/25/EC of the European\n             Parliament and of the Council (1).\n     (28)    Research and estimates based on publicly available data, should not per se be regarded as inside information and\n             the mere fact that a transaction is carried out on the basis of research or estimates should not therefore be deemed\n             to constitute use of inside information. However, for example, where the publication or distribution of information\n             is routinely expected by the market and where such publication or distribution contributes to the price-formation\n             process of financial instruments, or the information provides views from a recognised market commentator or\n             institution which may inform the prices of related financial instruments, the information may constitute inside\n             information. Market actors must therefore consider the extent to which the information is non-public and the\n             possible effect on financial instruments traded in advance of its publication or distribution, to establish whether\n             they would be trading on the basis of inside information.\n     (29)    In order to avoid inadvertently prohibiting forms of financial activity which are legitimate, namely where there is\n             no effect of market abuse, it is necessary to recognise certain legitimate behaviour. This may include, for example,\n             recognising the role of market makers, when acting in the legitimate capacity of providing market liquidity.\n     (30)    The mere fact that market makers or persons authorised to act as counterparties confine themselves to pursuing\n             their legitimate business of buying or selling financial instruments or that persons authorised to execute orders on\n             behalf of third parties with inside information confine themselves to carrying out, cancelling or amending an order\n             dutifully, should not be deemed to constitute use of such inside information. However, the protection, laid down\n             in this Regulation, of market makers, bodies authorised to act as counterparties or persons authorised to execute\n             orders on behalf of third parties with inside information, does not extend to activities clearly prohibited under this\n             Regulation including, for example, the practice commonly known as \u2018front-running\u2019. Where legal persons have\n             taken all reasonable measures to prevent market abuse from occurring but nevertheless natural persons within\n             their employment commit market abuse on behalf of the legal person, this should not be deemed to constitute\n             market abuse by the legal person. Another example that should not be deemed to constitute use of inside\n             information is transactions conducted in the discharge of a prior obligation that has become due. The mere\n             fact of having access to inside information relating to another company and using it in the context of a public\n             takeover bid for the purpose of gaining control of that company or proposing a merger with that company should\n             not be deemed to constitute insider dealing.\n     (1) Directive 2004/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on takeover bids (OJ L 142, 30.4.2004,\n         p. 12).\n\n\n12.6.2014          EN                            Official Journal of the European Union                                         L 173/7\n      (31) Since the acquisition or disposal of financial instruments necessarily involves a prior decision to acquire or dispose\n           taken by the person who undertakes one or other of those operations, the mere fact of making such an acquisition\n           or disposal should not be deemed to constitute use of inside information. Acting on the basis of one\u2019s own plans\n           and strategies for trading should not be considered as using inside information. However, none of those legal or\n           natural persons should be protected by virtue of their professional function; they should only be protected if they\n           act in a fit and proper manner, meeting both the standards expected of their profession and of this Regulation\n           namely market integrity and investor protection. An infringement could still be deemed to have occurred if the\n           competent authority established that there was an illegitimate reason behind those transactions or orders or that\n           behaviour, or that the person used inside information.\n      (32) Market soundings are interactions between a seller of financial instruments and one or more potential investors,\n           prior to the announcement of a transaction, in order to gauge the interest of potential investors in a possible\n           transaction and its pricing, size and structuring. Market soundings could involve an initial or secondary offer of\n           relevant securities, and are distinct from ordinary trading. They are a highly valuable tool to gauge the opinion of\n           potential investors, enhance shareholder dialogue, ensure that deals run smoothly, and that the views of issuers,\n           existing shareholders and potential new investors are aligned. They may be particularly beneficial when markets\n           lack confidence or a relevant benchmark, or are volatile. Thus the ability to conduct market soundings is important\n           for the proper functioning of financial markets and market soundings should not in themselves be regarded as\n           market abuse.\n      (33) Examples of market soundings include situations in which the sell-side firm has been in discussions with an issuer\n           about a potential transaction, and it has decided to gauge potential investor interest in order to determine the\n           terms that will make up a transaction; where an issuer intends to announce a debt issuance or additional equity\n           offering and key investors are contacted by a sell-side firm and given the full terms of the deal to obtain a financial\n           commitment to participate in the transaction; or where the sell-side is seeking to sell a large amount of securities\n           on behalf of an investor and seeks to gauge potential interest in those securities from other potential investors.\n      (34) Conducting market soundings may require disclosure to potential investors of inside information. There will\n           generally only be the potential to benefit financially from trading on the basis of inside information passed in\n           a market sounding where there is an existing market in the financial instrument that is the subject of the market\n           sounding or in a related financial instrument. Given the timing of such discussions, it is possible that inside\n           information may be disclosed to the potential investor in the course of the market sounding after a financial\n           instrument has been admitted to trading on a regulated market or has been traded on an MTF or an OTF. Before\n           engaging in a market sounding, the disclosing market participant should assess whether that market sounding will\n           involve the disclosure of inside information.\n      (35) Inside information should be deemed as being disclosed legitimately if it is disclosed in the normal course of the\n           exercise of a person\u2019s employment, profession or duties. Where a market sounding involves the disclosure of inside\n           information, the disclosing market participant will be considered to be acting within the normal course of his\n           employment, profession or duties where, at the time of making the disclosure, he informs and receives the consent\n           of the person to whom the disclosure is made that he may be given inside information; that he will be restricted\n           by the provisions of this Regulation from trading or acting on that information; that reasonable steps must be\n           taken to protect the ongoing confidentiality of the information; and that he must inform the disclosing market\n           participant of the identities of all natural and legal persons to whom the information is disclosed in the course of\n           developing a response to the market sounding. The disclosing market participant should also comply with the\n           obligations, to be set out in detail in regulatory technical standards, regarding the maintenance of records of\n           information disclosed. There should be no presumption that market participants that do not comply with this\n           Regulation when conducting a market sounding have unlawfully disclosed inside information but they should not\n           be able to take advantage of the exemption given to those who have complied with such provisions. The question\n           whether they have infringed the prohibition against the unlawful disclosure of inside information should be\n           analysed in light of all the relevant provisions of this Regulation, and all disclosing market participants should\n           be under an obligation to record in writing their assessment, before engaging in a market sounding, whether that\n           market sounding will involve the disclosure of inside information.\n\n\nL 173/8            EN                          Official Journal of the European Union                                       12.6.2014\n     (36) Potential investors who are the subject of a market sounding should, in turn, consider if the information disclosed\n          to them amounts to inside information which would prohibit them from dealing on the basis of it or further\n          disclosing that information. Potential investors remain subject to the rules on insider dealing and unlawful\n          disclosure of inside information, as set out in this Regulation. In order to assist potential investors in their\n          considerations and as regards what steps they should take so as not to contravene this Regulation, ESMA\n          should issue guidelines.\n     (37) Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 provides for two parallel market abuse regimes applicable to the auctions of\n          emission allowances. However, as a consequence of the classification of emission allowances as financial instru\u00ad\n          ments, this Regulation should constitute a single rule book of market abuse measures applicable to the entirety of\n          the primary and secondary markets in emission allowances. This Regulation should also apply to behaviour or\n          transactions, including bids, relating to the auctioning on an auction platform authorised as a regulated market of\n          emission allowances or other auctioned products based thereon, including when auctioned products are not\n          financial instruments, pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010.\n     (38) This Regulation should provide measures regarding market manipulation that are capable of being adapted to new\n          forms of trading or new strategies that may be abusive. To reflect the fact that trading in financial instruments is\n          increasingly automated, it is desirable that the definition of market manipulation provide examples of specific\n          abusive strategies that may be carried out by any available means of trading including algorithmic and high-\n          frequency trading. The examples provided are neither intended to be exhaustive nor intended to suggest that the\n          same strategies carried out by other means would not also be abusive.\n     (39) The prohibitions against market abuse should also cover those persons who act in collaboration to commit market\n          abuse. Examples could include, but are not limited to, brokers who devise and recommend a trading strategy\n          designed to result in market abuse, persons who encourage a person with inside information to disclose that\n          information unlawfully or persons who develop software in collaboration with a trader for the purpose of\n          facilitating market abuse.\n     (40) To ensure that liability is conferred on both the legal person and any natural person who participates in the\n          decision-making of the legal person, it is necessary to give recognition of the different national legal mechanisms\n          in Member States. Such mechanisms should relate directly to the methods of attribution of liability in national law.\n     (41) In order to complement the prohibition of market manipulation, this Regulation should include a prohibition\n          against attempting to engage in market manipulation. An attempt to engage in market manipulation should be\n          distinguished from behaviour which is likely to result in market manipulation as both activities are prohibited\n          under this Regulation. Such an attempt may include situations where the activity is started but is not completed,\n          for example as a result of failed technology or an instruction to trade which is not acted upon. Prohibiting\n          attempts to engage in market manipulation is necessary to enable competent authorities to impose sanctions for\n          such attempts.\n     (42) Without prejudice to the aim of this Regulation and its directly applicable provisions, a person who enters into\n          transactions or issues orders to trade which may be deemed to constitute market manipulation may be able to\n          establish that his reasons for entering into such transactions or issuing orders to trade were legitimate and that the\n          transactions and orders to trade were in conformity with accepted practice on the market concerned. An accepted\n          market practice can only be established by the competent authority responsible for the market abuse supervision\n          of the market concerned. A practice that is accepted in a particular market cannot be considered applicable to\n          other markets unless the competent authorities of such other markets have officially accepted that practice. An\n          infringement could still be deemed to have occurred if the competent authority established that there was an\n          illegitimate reason behind these transactions or orders to trade.\n     (43) This Regulation should also clarify that engaging in market manipulation or attempting to engage in market\n          manipulation in a financial instrument may take the form of using related financial instruments such as derivative\n          instruments that are traded on another trading venue or OTC.\n\n\n12.6.2014           EN                          Official Journal of the European Union                                           L 173/9\n      (44) Many financial instruments are priced by reference to benchmarks. The actual or attempted manipulation of\n           benchmarks, including interbank offer rates, can have a serious impact on market confidence and may result in\n           significant losses to investors or distort the real economy. Therefore, specific provisions in relation to benchmarks\n           are required in order to preserve the integrity of the markets and ensure that competent authorities can enforce a\n           clear prohibition of the manipulation of benchmarks. Those provisions should cover all published benchmarks\n           including those accessible through the internet whether free of charge or not such as CDS benchmarks and indices\n           of indices. It is necessary to complement the general prohibition of market manipulation by prohibiting the\n           manipulation of the benchmark itself and the transmission of false or misleading information, provision of\n           false or misleading inputs, or any other action that manipulates the calculation of a benchmark, where that\n           calculation is broadly defined to include the receipt and evaluation of all data which relates to the calculation\n           of that benchmark and include in particular trimmed data, and including the benchmark\u2019s methodology, whether\n           algorithmic or judgement-based in whole or in part. Those rules are in addition to Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011\n           which prohibits the deliberate provision of false information to undertakings which provide price assessments or\n           market reports on wholesale energy products with the effect of misleading market participants acting on the basis\n           of those price assessments or market reports.\n      (45) In order to ensure uniform market conditions between trading venues and facilities subject to this Regulation, any\n           person who operates regulated markets, MTFs and OTFs should be required to establish and to maintain effective\n           arrangements, systems and procedures aimed at preventing and detecting market manipulation and abusive prac\u00ad\n           tices.\n      (46) Manipulation or attempted manipulation of financial instruments may also consist in placing orders which may\n           not be executed. Furthermore, a financial instrument may be manipulated through behaviour which occurs outside\n           a trading venue. Persons professionally arranging or executing transactions should be required to establish and to\n           maintain effective arrangements, systems and procedures in place to detect and report suspicious transactions. They\n           should also report suspicious orders and suspicious transactions that take place outside a trading venue.\n      (47) The manipulation or attempted manipulation of financial instruments may also consist in disseminating false or\n           misleading information. The spreading of false or misleading information can have a significant impact on the\n           prices of financial instruments in a relatively short period of time. It may consist in the invention of manifestly\n           false information, but also the wilful omission of material facts, as well as the knowingly inaccurate reporting of\n           information. That form of market manipulation is particularly harmful to investors, because it causes them to base\n           their investment decisions on incorrect or distorted information. It is also harmful to issuers, because it reduces the\n           trust in the available information related to them. A lack of market trust can in turn jeopardise an issuer\u2019s ability to\n           issue new financial instruments or to secure credit from other market participants in order to finance its oper\u00ad\n           ations. Information spreads through the market place very quickly. As a result, the harm to investors and issuers\n           may persist for a relatively long time until the information is found to be false or misleading, and can be corrected\n           by the issuer or those responsible for its dissemination. It is therefore necessary to qualify the spreading of false or\n           misleading information, including rumours and false or misleading news, as being an infringement of this\n           Regulation. It is therefore appropriate not to allow those active in the financial markets to freely express\n           information contrary to their own opinion or better judgement, which they know or should know to be false\n           or misleading, to the detriment of investors and issuers.\n      (48) Given the rise in the use of websites, blogs and social media, it is important to clarify that disseminating false or\n           misleading information via the internet, including through social media sites or unattributable blogs, should be\n           considered, for the purposes of this Regulation, to be equivalent to doing so via more traditional communication\n           channels.\n      (49) The public disclosure of inside information by an issuer is essential to avoid insider dealing and ensure that\n           investors are not misled. Issuers should therefore be required to inform the public as soon as possible of inside\n           information. However that obligation may, under special circumstances, prejudice the legitimate interests of the\n           issuer. In such circumstances, delayed disclosure should be permitted provided that the delay would not be likely to\n           mislead the public and the issuer is able to ensure the confidentiality of the information. The issuer is only under\n           an obligation to disclose inside information if it has requested or approved admission of the financial instrument\n           to trading.\n\n\nL 173/10          EN                             Official Journal of the European Union                                       12.6.2014\n     (50) For the purposes of applying the requirements relating to public disclosure of inside information and delaying such\n          public disclosure, as provided for in this Regulation, legitimate interests may, in particular, relate to the following\n          non-exhaustive circumstances: (a) ongoing negotiations, or related elements, where the outcome or normal pattern\n          of those negotiations would be likely to be affected by public disclosure. In particular, in the event that the\n          financial viability of the issuer is in grave and imminent danger, although not within the scope of the applicable\n          insolvency law, public disclosure of information may be delayed for a limited period where such a public\n          disclosure would seriously jeopardise the interest of existing and potential shareholders by undermining the\n          conclusion of specific negotiations designed to ensure the long-term financial recovery of the issuer; (b)\n          decisions taken or contracts made by the management body of an issuer which need the approval of another\n          body of the issuer in order to become effective, where the organisation of such an issuer requires the separation\n          between those bodies, provided that public disclosure of the information before such approval, together with the\n          simultaneous announcement that the approval remains pending, would jeopardise the correct assessment of the\n          information by the public.\n     (51) Moreover, the requirement to disclose inside information needs to be addressed to the participants in the emission\n          allowance market. In order to avoid exposing the market to reporting that is not useful and to maintain cost-\n          efficiency of the measure foreseen, it appears necessary to limit the regulatory impact of that requirement to only\n          those EU ETS operators which, by virtue of their size and activity, can reasonably be expected to be able to have a\n          significant effect on the price of emission allowances, of auctioned products based thereon, or of derivative\n          financial instruments relating thereto and for bidding in the auctions pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010.\n          The Commission should adopt measures establishing a minimum threshold for the purposes of application of that\n          exemption by means of a delegated act. The information to be disclosed should concern the physical operations of\n          the disclosing party and not own plans or strategies for trading emission allowances, auctioned products based\n          thereon, or derivative financial instruments relating thereto. Where emission allowance market participants already\n          comply with equivalent inside information disclosure requirements, notably pursuant to Regulation (EU)\n          No 1227/2011, the obligation to disclose inside information concerning emission allowances should not lead\n          to the duplication of mandatory disclosures with substantially the same content. In the case of participants in the\n          emission allowance market with aggregate emissions or rated thermal input at or below the threshold set, since the\n          information about their physical operations is deemed to be non-material for the purposes of disclosure, it should\n          also be deemed not to have a significant effect on the price of emission allowances, of auctioned products based\n          thereon, or of the derivative financial instruments relating thereto. Such participants in the emission allowance\n          market should nevertheless be covered by the prohibition of insider dealing in relation to any other information\n          they have access to and which is inside information.\n     (52) In order to protect the public interest, to preserve the stability of the financial system and, for example, to avoid\n          liquidity crises in financial institutions from turning into solvency crises due to a sudden withdrawal of funds, it\n          may be appropriate to allow, in exceptional circumstances, the delay of the disclosure of inside information for\n          credit institutions or financial institutions. In particular, this may apply to information pertinent to temporary\n          liquidity problems, where they need to receive central banking lending including emergency liquidity assistance\n          from a central bank where disclosure of the information would have a systemic impact. This delay should be\n          conditional upon the issuer obtaining the consent of the relevant competent authority and it being clear that the\n          wider public and economic interest in delaying disclosure outweighs the interest of the market in receiving the\n          information which is subject to delay.\n     (53) In respect of financial institutions, in particular where they receive central bank lending, including emergency\n          liquidity assistance, the assessment of whether the information is of systemic importance and whether delay of\n          disclosure is in the public interest should be made by the competent authority, after consulting, as appropriate, the\n          national central bank, the macro-prudential authority or any other relevant national authority.\n     (54) The use or attempted use of inside information to trade on one\u2019s own account or on the account of a third party\n          should be clearly prohibited. Use of inside information can also consist of trading in emission allowances and\n          derivatives thereof and of bidding in the auctions of emission allowances or other auctioned products based\n          thereon that are held pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 by persons who know, or who ought to\n          know, that the information they possess constitutes inside information. Information regarding the market partici\u00ad\n          pant\u2019s own plans and strategies for trading should not be considered to be inside information, although\n          information regarding a third party\u2019s plans and strategies for trading may amount to inside information.\n\n\n12.6.2014             EN                            Official Journal of the European Union                                           L 173/11\n      (55)    The requirement to disclose inside information can be burdensome for small and medium-sized enterprises, as\n              defined in Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (1), whose financial instruments\n              are admitted to trading on SME growth markets, given the costs of monitoring information in their possession and\n              seeking legal advice about whether and when information needs to be disclosed. Nevertheless, prompt disclosure of\n              inside information is essential to ensure investor confidence in those issuers. Therefore, ESMA should be able to\n              issue guidelines which assist issuers to comply with the obligation to disclose inside information without compro\u00ad\n              mising investor protection.\n      (56)    Insider lists are an important tool for regulators when investigating possible market abuse, but national differences\n              in regard to data to be included in those lists impose unnecessary administrative burdens on issuers. Data fields\n              required for insider lists should therefore be uniform in order to reduce those costs. It is important that persons\n              included on insider lists are informed of that fact and of its implications under this Regulation and Directive\n              2014/57/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (2). The requirement to keep and constantly update\n              insider lists imposes administrative burdens specifically on issuers on SME growth markets. As competent\n              authorities are able to exercise effective market abuse supervision without having those lists available at all\n              times for those issuers, they should be exempt from this obligation in order to reduce the administrative costs\n              imposed by this Regulation. However, such issuers should provide an insider list to the competent authorities upon\n              request.\n      (57)    The establishment, by issuers or any person acting on their behalf or account, of lists of persons working for them\n              under a contract of employment or otherwise and having access to inside information relating, directly or indi\u00ad\n              rectly, to the issuer, is a valuable measure for protecting market integrity. Such lists may serve issuers or such\n              persons to control the flow of inside information and thereby help manage their confidentiality duties. Moreover,\n              such lists may also constitute a useful tool for competent authorities to identify any person who has access to\n              inside information and the date on which they gained access. Access to inside information relating, directly or\n              indirectly, to the issuer by persons included on such a list is without prejudice to the prohibitions laid down in this\n              Regulation.\n      (58)    Greater transparency of transactions conducted by persons discharging managerial responsibilities at the issuer\n              level and, where applicable, persons closely associated with them, constitutes a preventive measure against market\n              abuse, particularly insider dealing. The publication of those transactions on at least an individual basis can also be a\n              highly valuable source of information to investors. It is necessary to clarify that the obligation to publish those\n              managers\u2019 transactions also includes the pledging or lending of financial instruments, as the pledging of shares can\n              result in a material and potentially destabilising impact on the company in the event of a sudden, unforeseen\n              disposal. Without disclosure, the market would not know that there was the increased possibility of, for example, a\n              significant future change in share ownership, an increase in the supply of shares to the marketplace or a loss of\n              voting rights in that company. For that reason, notification under this Regulation is required where the pledge of\n              the securities is made as part of a wider transaction in which the manager pledges the securities as collateral to\n              gain credit from a third party. Additionally, full and proper market transparency is a prerequisite for the confidence\n              of market actors and, in particular, the confidence of a company\u2019s shareholders. It is also necessary to clarify that\n              the obligation to publish those managers\u2019 transactions includes transactions by another person exercising discretion\n              for the manager. In order to ensure an appropriate balance between the level of transparency and the number of\n              reports notified to competent authorities and the public, thresholds should be introduced in this Regulation below\n              which transactions need not be notified.\n      (59)    The notification of transactions conducted by persons discharging managerial responsibilities on their own\n              account, or by a person closely associated with them, is not only valuable information for market participants,\n              but also constitutes an additional means for competent authorities to supervise markets. The obligation to notify\n              transactions is without prejudice to the prohibitions laid down in this Regulation.\n      (60)    Notification of transactions should be in accordance with the rules on transfer of personal data laid down in\n              Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3).\n      (1) Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and\n          amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/67/EU (see page 349 of this Official Journal).\n      (2) Directive 2014/57/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on criminal sanctions for market abuse\n          (market abuse directive) (see page 179 of this Official Journal).\n      (3) Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on protection of individuals with regard to\n          the processing of personal data and on the movement of such data (OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31).\n\n\nL 173/12           EN                         Official Journal of the European Union                                        12.6.2014\n     (61) Persons discharging managerial responsibilities should be prohibited from trading before the announcement of an\n          interim financial report or a year-end report which the relevant issuer is obliged to make public according to the\n          rules of the trading venue where the issuer\u2019s shares are admitted to trading or according to national law, unless\n          specific and restricted circumstances exist which would justify a permission by the issuer allowing a person\n          discharging managerial responsibilities to trade. However, any such permission by the issuer is without\n          prejudice to the prohibitions laid down in this Regulation.\n     (62) A set of effective tools and powers and resources for the competent authority of each Member State guarantees\n          supervisory effectiveness. Accordingly, this Regulation, in particular, provides for a minimum set of supervisory\n          and investigative powers competent authorities of Member States should be entrusted with under national law.\n          Those powers should be exercised, where the national law so requires, by application to the competent judicial\n          authorities. When exercising their powers under this Regulation competent authorities should act objectively and\n          impartially and should remain autonomous in their decision making.\n     (63) Market undertakings and all economic actors should also contribute to market integrity. In that sense, the\n          designation of a single competent authority for market abuse should not exclude collaboration links or delegation\n          under the responsibility of the competent authority, between that authority and market undertakings with a view\n          to guaranteeing efficient supervision of compliance with the provisions in this Regulation. Where persons who\n          produce or disseminate investment recommendations or other information recommending or suggesting an\n          investment strategy in one or more financial instruments also deal on own account in such instruments, the\n          competent authorities should, inter alia, be able to require or demand from such persons any information\n          necessary to determine whether the recommendations produced or disseminated by that person are compliant\n          with this Regulation.\n     (64) For the purpose of detecting cases of insider dealing and market manipulation, it is necessary for competent\n          authorities to have, in accordance with national law, the ability to access the premises of natural and legal persons\n          in order to seize documents. Access to such premises is necessary where there is a reasonable suspicion that\n          documents and other data relating to the subject matter of an investigation exist and may be relevant to prove a\n          case of insider dealing or market abuse. Additionally access to such premises is necessary where the person of\n          whom a demand for information has already been made fails, wholly or in part, to comply with it or where there\n          are reasonable grounds for believing that if a demand were to be made it would not be complied with or that the\n          documents or information to which the information requirement relates would be removed, tampered with or\n          destroyed. If prior authorisation is needed from the judicial authority of the Member State concerned, in\n          accordance with national law, access to premises should take place after having obtained that prior judicial\n          authorisation.\n     (65) Existing recordings of telephone conversations and data traffic records from investment firms, credit institutions\n          and financial institutions executing and documenting the execution of transactions, as well as existing telephone\n          and data traffic records from telecommunications operators, constitute crucial, and sometimes the only, evidence\n          to detect and prove the existence of insider dealing and market manipulation. Telephone and data traffic records\n          may establish the identity of a person responsible for the dissemination of false or misleading information or that\n          persons have been in contact at a certain time, and that a relationship exists between two or more people.\n          Therefore, competent authorities should be able to require existing recordings of telephone conversations, elec\u00ad\n          tronic communications and data traffic records held by an investment firm, a credit institution or a financial\n          institution in accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU. Access to data and telephone records is necessary to provide\n          evidence and investigate leads on possible insider dealing or market manipulation, and therefore for detecting and\n          imposing sanctions for market abuse. In order to introduce a level playing field in the Union in relation to the\n          access to telephone and existing data traffic records held by a telecommunications operator or the existing\n          recordings of telephone conversations and data traffic held by an investment firm, a credit institution or a\n          financial institution, competent authorities should, in accordance with national law, be able to require existing\n          telephone and existing data traffic records held by a telecommunications operator, insofar as permitted under\n          national law and existing recordings of telephone conversations as well as data traffic held by an investment firm,\n          in cases where a reasonable suspicion exists that such records related to the subject matter of the inspection or\n          investigation may be relevant to prove insider dealing or market manipulation infringing this Regulation. Access to\n          telephone and data traffic records held by a telecommunications operator does not encompass access to the\n          content of voice communications by telephone.\n\n\n12.6.2014             EN                            Official Journal of the European Union                                         L 173/13\n      (66)    While this Regulation specifies a minimum set of powers competent authorities should have, those powers are to\n              be exercised within a complete system of national law which guarantees the respect for fundamental rights,\n              including the right to privacy. For the exercise of those powers, which may amount to serious interferences\n              with the right to respect for private and family life, home and communications, Member States should have in\n              place adequate and effective safeguards against any abuse, for instance, where appropriate a requirement to obtain\n              prior authorisation from the judicial authorities of a Member State concerned. Member States should allow the\n              possibility for competent authorities to exercise such intrusive powers to the extent necessary for the proper\n              investigation of serious cases where there are no equivalent means for effectively achieving the same result.\n      (67)    Since market abuse can take place across borders and markets, in all but exceptional circumstances competent\n              authorities should be required to cooperate and exchange information with other competent and regulatory\n              authorities, and with ESMA, in particular in relation to investigation activities. Where a competent authority is\n              convinced that market abuse is being, or has been, carried out in another Member State or affects financial\n              instruments traded in another Member State, it should notify that fact to the competent authority and ESMA.\n              In cases of market abuse with cross-border effects, ESMA should be able to coordinate the investigation if\n              requested to do so by one of the competent authorities concerned.\n      (68)    It is necessary for competent authorities to have the necessary tools for effective cross-market order book\n              surveillance. Pursuant to Directive 2014/65/EU, competent authorities are able to request and receive data from\n              other competent authorities relating to the order book to assist in monitoring and detecting market manipulation\n              on a cross-border basis.\n      (69)    In order to ensure exchanges of information and cooperation with third-country authorities in relation to the\n              effective enforcement of this Regulation, competent authorities should conclude cooperation arrangements with\n              their counterparts in third countries. Any transfer of personal data carried out on the basis of those agreements\n              should comply with Directive 95/46/EC and with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of\n              the Council (1).\n      (70)    A sound prudential and conduct of business framework for the financial sector should rest on strong supervisory,\n              investigation and sanction regimes. To that end, supervisory authorities should be equipped with sufficient powers\n              to act and should be able to rely on equal, strong and deterrent sanction regimes against all financial misconduct,\n              and sanctions should be enforced effectively. However, the de Larosi\u00e8re Group considered that none of those\n              elements is currently in place. A review of existing powers to impose sanctions and their practical application\n              aimed at promoting convergence of sanctions across the range of supervisory activities has been carried out in the\n              Commission Communication of 8 December 2010 on Reinforcing sanctioning regimes in the financial sector.\n      (71)    Therefore, a set of administrative sanctions and other administrative measures should be provided for to ensure a\n              common approach in Member States and to enhance their deterrent effect. The possibility of a ban from exercising\n              management functions within investment firms should be available to the competent authority. Sanctions imposed\n              in specific cases should be determined taking into account where appropriate factors such as the disgorgement of\n              any identified financial benefit, the gravity and duration of the infringement, any aggravating or mitigating factors,\n              the need for fines to have a deterrent effect and, where appropriate, include a discount for cooperation with the\n              competent authority. In particular, the actual amount of administrative fines to be imposed in a specific case may\n              reach the maximum level provided for in this Regulation, or the higher level provided for in national law, for very\n              serious infringements, while fines significantly lower than the maximum level may be applied to minor\n              infringements or in case of settlement. This Regulation does not limit Member States\u2019 ability to provide for\n              higher administrative sanctions or other administrative measures.\n      (72)    Even though nothing prevents Member States from laying down rules for administrative as well as criminal\n              sanctions for the same infringements, they should not be required to lay down rules for administrative\n              sanctions for infringements of this Regulation which are already subject to national criminal law by 3 July\n              2016. In accordance with national law, Member States are not obliged to impose both administrative and\n      (1) Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals\n          with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\n          (OJ L 8, 12.1.2001, p. 1).\n\n\nL 173/14             EN                             Official Journal of the European Union                                             12.6.2014\n             criminal sanctions for the same offence, but they can do so if their national law so permits. However, maintenance\n             of criminal sanctions rather than administrative sanctions for infringements of this Regulation or of Directive\n             2014/57/EU should not reduce or otherwise affect the ability of competent authorities to cooperate and access and\n             exchange information in a timely manner with competent authorities in other Member States for the purposes of\n             this Regulation, including after any referral of the relevant infringements to the competent judicial authorities for\n             criminal prosecution.\n     (73)    In order to ensure that decisions made by competent authorities have a dissuasive effect on the public at large, they\n             should normally be published. The publication of decisions is also an important tool for competent authorities to\n             inform market participants of what behaviour is considered to be an infringement of this Regulation and to\n             promote good behaviour amongst market participants. If such publication causes disproportionate damage to the\n             persons involved or jeopardises the stability of financial markets or an ongoing investigation the competent\n             authority should publish the administrative sanctions and other administrative measures on an anonymous\n             basis in accordance with national law or delay the publication. Competent authorities should have the option\n             of not publishing sanctions and other administrative measures where anonymous or delayed publication is\n             considered to be insufficient to ensure that the stability of the financial markets will not be jeopardised.\n             Competent authorities should also not be required to publish measures which are deemed to be of a minor\n             nature and the publication of which would be disproportionate.\n     (74)    Whistleblowers may bring new information to the attention of competent authorities which assists them in\n             detecting and imposing sanctions in cases of insider dealing and market manipulation. However, whistleblowing\n             may be deterred for fear of retaliation, or for lack of incentives. Reporting of infringements of this Regulation is\n             necessary to ensure that a competent authority may detect and impose sanctions for market abuse. Measures\n             regarding whistleblowing are necessary to facilitate detection of market abuse and to ensure the protection and the\n             respect of the rights of the whistleblower and the accused person. This Regulation should therefore ensure that\n             adequate arrangements are in place to enable whistleblowers to alert competent authorities to possible\n             infringements of this Regulation and to protect them from retaliation. Member States should be allowed to\n             provide for financial incentives for those persons who offer relevant information about potential infringements\n             of this Regulation. However, whistleblowers should only be entitled to such financial incentives where they bring\n             to light new information which they are not already legally obliged to notify and where that information results in\n             a sanction for an infringement of this Regulation. Member States should also ensure that whistleblowing schemes\n             that they implement include mechanisms that provide appropriate protection of an accused person, particularly\n             with regard to the right to the protection of his personal data and procedures to ensure the right of the accused\n             person of defence and to be heard before the adoption of a decision concerning him as well as the right to seek\n             effective remedy before a court against a decision concerning him.\n     (75)    Since Member States have adopted legislation implementing Directive 2003/6/EC, and since the delegated acts,\n             regulatory technical standards and implementing technical standards provided for in this Regulation should be\n             adopted before the framework to be introduced can be usefully applied, it is necessary to defer the application of\n             the substantive provisions of this Regulation for a sufficient period of time.\n     (76)    In order to facilitate a smooth transition to the entry into application of this Regulation, market practices existing\n             before the entry into force of this Regulation and accepted by competent authorities in accordance with\n             Commission Regulation (EC) No 2273/2003 (1) for the purpose of applying point 2(a) of Article 1 of Directive\n             2003/6/EC, may remain applicable provided that they are notified to ESMA within a prescribed time period, until\n             the competent authority has made a decision regarding the continuation of those practices in accordance with this\n             Regulation.\n     (77)    This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of Funda\u00ad\n             mental Rights of the European Union (Charter). Accordingly, this Regulation should be interpreted and applied in\n             accordance with those rights and principles. In particular, when this Regulation refers to rules governing the\n             freedom of the press and the freedom of expression in other media and the rules or codes governing the journalist\n             profession, account should be taken of those freedoms as guaranteed in the Union and in the Member States and\n             as recognised pursuant to Article 11 of the Charter and to other relevant provisions.\n     (1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2273/2003 of 22 December 2003 implementing Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament\n         and of the Council as regards exemptions for buy-back programmes and stabilisation of financial instruments (OJ L 336, 23.12.2003,\n         p. 33).\n\n\n12.6.2014              EN                           Official Journal of the European Union                                            L 173/15\n      (78)    In order to increase transparency and to better inform the operation of the sanction regimes, competent authorities\n              should provide anonymised and aggregated data to ESMA on an annual basis. That data should comprise the\n              number of investigations that have been opened, the number that are ongoing and the number that have been\n              closed during the relevant period.\n      (79)    Directive 95/46/EC and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 govern the processing of personal data carried out by ESMA\n              within the framework of this Regulation and under the supervision of the Member States competent authorities, in\n              particular the public independent authorities designated by the Member States. Any exchange or transmission of\n              information by competent authorities should be in accordance with the rules on the transfer of personal data as\n              laid down in Directive 95/46/EC. Any exchange or transmission of information by ESMA should be in accordance\n              with the rules on the transfer of personal data as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001.\n      (80)    This Regulation, as well as the delegated acts, implementing acts, regulatory technical standards, implementing\n              technical standards and guidelines adopted in accordance therewith, are without prejudice to the application of\n              Union rules on competition.\n      (81)    In order to specify the requirements set out in this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with\n              Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the exemption from the scope of this\n              Regulation of certain public bodies and central banks of third countries and of certain designated public bodies of\n              third countries that have a linking agreement with the Union within the meaning of Article 25 of Directive\n              2003/87/EC; the indicators for manipulative behaviour listed in Annex I to this Regulation; the thresholds for\n              determining the application of the public disclosure obligation to emission allowance market participants; the\n              circumstances under which trading during a closed period is permitted; and the types of certain transactions\n              conducted by persons discharging managerial responsibilities or persons closely associated with them that would\n              trigger a requirement to notify. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consul\u00ad\n              tations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up\n              delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the\n              European Parliament and to the Council.\n      (82)    In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation in respect of procedures for the\n              reporting of infringements of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to\n              specify those procedures, including the arrangements for following up of the reports and measures for the\n              protection of persons working under a contract of employment and measures for the protection of personal\n              data. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European\n              Parliament and of the Council (1).\n      (83)    Technical standards in financial services should ensure uniform conditions across the Union in matters covered by\n              this Regulation. As a body with highly specialised expertise, it would be efficient and appropriate to entrust ESMA\n              with the elaboration of draft regulatory technical standards and draft implementing technical standards which do\n              not involve policy choices, for submission to the Commission.\n      (84)    The Commission should be empowered to adopt the draft regulatory technical standards developed by ESMA to\n              specify the content of notifications that will have to be made by the operators of regulated markets, MTFs and\n              OTFs concerning the financial instruments that are admitted to trading, traded, or for which a request for\n              admission to trading on their trading venue has been made; the manner and conditions of compilation, publication\n              and maintenance of the list of those instruments by ESMA; the conditions that buy-back programmes and\n              stabilisation measures must meet including conditions for trading, time and volume restrictions, disclosure and\n              reporting obligations and price conditions for the stabilisation; in relation to procedures and arrangements, systems\n              for trading venues aimed at preventing and detecting market abuse and of systems and templates to be used by\n      (1) Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general\n          principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55,\n          28.2.2011, p. 13).\n\n\nL 173/16             EN                           Official Journal of the European Union                                     12.6.2014\n             persons in order to detect and notify suspicious orders and transactions; appropriate arrangements, procedures and\n             record-keeping requirements in the process of market soundings; and in respect of technical arrangements for\n             categories of persons for objective presentation of information recommending an investment strategy and for\n             disclosure of particular interests or indications of conflicts of interest by means of delegated acts pursuant to\n             Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European\n             Parliament and of the Council (1). It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate\n             consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.\n     (85)    The Commission should also be empowered to adopt implementing technical standards by means of implementing\n             acts pursuant to Article 291 TFEU and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. ESMA\n             should be entrusted with drafting implementing technical standards for submission to the Commission with regard\n             to public disclosure of inside information, formats of insider lists and formats and procedures for the cooperation\n             and exchange of information of competent authorities among themselves and with ESMA.\n     (86)    Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to prevent market abuse in the form of insider dealing, the unlawful\n             disclosure of inside information and market manipulation, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States\n             but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures,\n             in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In\n             accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond\n             what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n     (87)    The provisions of Directive 2003/6/EC being no longer relevant or sufficient, that Directive should be repealed\n             from 3 July 2016. The requirements and prohibitions of this Regulation are strictly related to those in Directive\n             2014/65/EU and should therefore enter into force on the date of entry into force of that Directive.\n     (88)    For the correct application of this Regulation, it is necessary that Member States take all necessary measures in\n             order to ensure that their national law comply by 3 July 2016 with the provisions of this Regulation concerning\n             competent authorities and their powers, administrative sanctions and other administrative measures, the reporting\n             of infringements and the publication of decisions.\n     (89)    The European Data Protection Supervisor delivered an opinion on 10 February 2012 (2),\n     HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n                                                                CHAPTER 1\n                                                          GENERAL PROVISIONS\n                                                                  Article 1\n                                                              Subject matter\n     This Regulation establishes a common regulatory framework on insider dealing, the unlawful disclosure of inside\n     information and market manipulation (market abuse) as well as measures to prevent market abuse to ensure the\n     integrity of financial markets in the Union and to enhance investor protection and confidence in those markets.\n                                                                  Article 2\n                                                                   Scope\n     1.

The prohibitions and requirements in this Regulation shall apply to actions and omissions, in the Union and in a\n      third country, concerning the instruments referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.\n                                                                   Article 3\n                                                                 Definitions\n      1.

The Commission shall also be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 35 to extend the\n     exemption set out in paragraph 3 to certain designated public bodies of third countries that have entered into an\n     agreement with the Union pursuant to Article 25 of Directive 2003/87/EC.\n     7.

For the purposes of this Regulation, inside information shall comprise the following types of information:\n     (a) information of a precise nature, which has not been made public, relating, directly or indirectly, to one or more\n         issuers or to one or more financial instruments, and which, if it were made public, would be likely to have a\n         significant effect on the prices of those financial instruments or on the price of related derivative financial instru\u00ad\n         ments;\n     (b) in relation to commodity derivatives, information of a precise nature, which has not been made public, relating,\n         directly or indirectly to one or more such derivatives or relating directly to the related spot commodity contract, and\n         which, if it were made public, would be likely to have a significant effect on the prices of such derivatives or related\n         spot commodity contracts, and where this is information which is reasonably expected to be disclosed or is required\n         to be disclosed in accordance with legal or regulatory provisions at the Union or national level, market rules, contract,\n         practice or custom, on the relevant commodity derivatives markets or spot markets;\n     (c) in relation to emission allowances or auctioned products based thereon, information of a precise nature, which has\n         not been made public, relating, directly or indirectly, to one or more such instruments, and which, if it were made\n         public, would be likely to have a significant effect on the prices of such instruments or on the prices of related\n         derivative financial instruments;\n\n\n12.6.2014             EN                            Official Journal of the European Union                                      L 173/25\n      (d) for persons charged with the execution of orders concerning financial instruments, it also means information\n           conveyed by a client and relating to the client\u2019s pending orders in financial instruments, which is of a precise\n           nature, relating, directly or indirectly, to one or more issuers or to one or more financial instruments, and which,\n           if it were made public, would be likely to have a significant effect on the prices of those financial instruments, the\n           price of related spot commodity contracts, or on the price of related derivative financial instruments.\n      2.      For the purposes of paragraph 1, information shall be deemed to be of a precise nature if it indicates a set of\n      circumstances which exists or which may reasonably be expected to come into existence, or an event which has occurred\n      or which may reasonably be expected to occur, where it is specific enough to enable a conclusion to be drawn as to the\n      possible effect of that set of circumstances or event on the prices of the financial instruments or the related derivative\n      financial instrument, the related spot commodity contracts, or the auctioned products based on the emission allowances.\n      In this respect in the case of a protracted process that is intended to bring about, or that results in, particular circum\u00ad\n      stances or a particular event, those future circumstances or that future event, and also the intermediate steps of that\n      process which are connected with bringing about or resulting in those future circumstances or that future event, may be\n      deemed to be precise information.\n      3.      An intermediate step in a protracted process shall be deemed to be inside information if, by itself, it satisfies the\n      criteria of inside information as referred to in this Article.\n      4.      For the purposes of paragraph 1, information which, if it were made public, would be likely to have a significant\n      effect on the prices of financial instruments, derivative financial instruments, related spot commodity contracts, or\n      auctioned products based on emission allowances shall mean information a reasonable investor would be likely to\n      use as part of the basis of his or her investment decisions.\n      In the case of participants in the emission allowance market with aggregate emissions or rated thermal input at or below\n      the threshold set in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 17(2), information about their physical oper\u00ad\n      ations shall be deemed not to have a significant effect on the price of emission allowances, of auctioned products based\n      thereon, or of derivative financial instruments.\n      5.      ESMA shall issue guidelines to establish a non-exhaustive indicative list of information which is reasonably expected\n      or is required to be disclosed in accordance with legal or regulatory provisions in Union or national law, market rules,\n      contract, practice or custom, on the relevant commodity derivatives markets or spot markets as referred to in point (b) of\n      paragraph 1. ESMA shall duly take into account specificities of those markets.\n                                                                    Article 8\n                                                                Insider dealing\n      1.      For the purposes of this Regulation, insider dealing arises where a person possesses inside information and uses that\n      information by acquiring or disposing of, for its own account or for the account of a third party, directly or indirectly,\n      financial instruments to which that information relates. The use of inside information by cancelling or amending an order\n      concerning a financial instrument to which the information relates where the order was placed before the person\n      concerned possessed the inside information, shall also be considered to be insider dealing. In relation to auctions of\n      emission allowances or other auctioned products based thereon that are held pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010,\n      the use of inside information shall also comprise submitting, modifying or withdrawing a bid by a person for its own\n      account or for the account of a third party.\n      2.      For the purposes of this Regulation, recommending that another person engage in insider dealing, or inducing\n      another person to engage in insider dealing, arises where the person possesses inside information and:\n      (a) recommends, on the basis of that information, that another person acquire or dispose of financial instruments to\n           which that information relates, or induces that person to make such an acquisition or disposal, or\n      (b) recommends, on the basis of that information, that another person cancel or amend an order concerning a financial\n           instrument to which that information relates, or induces that person to make such a cancellation or amendment.\n\n\nL 173/26            EN                          Official Journal of the European Union                                      12.6.2014\n     3.    The use of the recommendations or inducements referred to in paragraph 2 amounts to insider dealing within the\n     meaning of this Article where the person using the recommendation or inducement knows or ought to know that it is\n     based upon inside information.\n     4.    This Article applies to any person who possesses inside information as a result of:\n     (a) being a member of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of the issuer or emission allowance market\n         participant;\n     (b) having a holding in the capital of the issuer or emission allowance market participant;\n     (c) having access to the information through the exercise of an employment, profession or duties; or\n     (d) being involved in criminal activities.\n     This Article also applies to any person who possesses inside information under circumstances other than those referred to\n     in the first subparagraph where that person knows or ought to know that it is inside information.\n     5.    Where the person is a legal person, this Article shall also apply, in accordance with national law, to the natural\n     persons who participate in the decision to carry out the acquisition, disposal, cancellation or amendment of an order for\n     the account of the legal person concerned.\n                                                                Article 9\n                                                         Legitimate behaviour\n     1.    For the purposes of Articles 8 and 14, it shall not be deemed from the mere fact that a legal person is or has been\n     in possession of inside information that that person has used that information and has thus engaged in insider dealing on\n     the basis of an acquisition or disposal, where that legal person:\n     (a) has established, implemented and maintained adequate and effective internal arrangements and procedures that\n         effectively ensure that neither the natural person who made the decision on its behalf to acquire or dispose of\n         financial instruments to which the information relates, nor another natural person who may have had an influence on\n         that decision, was in possession of the inside information; and\n     (b) has not encouraged, made a recommendation to, induced or otherwise influenced the natural person who, on behalf\n         of the legal person, acquired or disposed of financial instruments to which the information relates.\n     2.    For the purposes of Articles 8 and 14, it shall not be deemed from the mere fact that a person is in possession of\n     inside information that that person has used that information and has thus engaged in insider dealing on the basis of an\n     acquisition or disposal where that person:\n     (a) for the financial instrument to which that information relates, is a market maker or a person authorised to act as a\n         counterparty, and the acquisition or disposal of financial instruments to which that information relates is made\n         legitimately in the normal course of the exercise of its function as a market maker or as a counterparty for that\n         financial instrument; or\n     (b) is authorised to execute orders on behalf of third parties, and the acquisition or disposal of financial instruments to\n         which the order relates, is made to carry out such an order legitimately in the normal course of the exercise of that\n         person\u2019s employment, profession or duties.\n\n\n12.6.2014            EN                          Official Journal of the European Union                                        L 173/27\n      3.    For the purposes of Articles 8 and 14, it shall not be deemed from the mere fact that a person is in possession of\n      inside information that that person has used that information and has thus engaged in insider dealing on the basis of an\n      acquisition or disposal where that person conducts a transaction to acquire or dispose of financial instruments and that\n      transaction is carried out in the discharge of an obligation that has become due in good faith and not to circumvent the\n      prohibition against insider dealing and:\n      (a) that obligation results from an order placed or an agreement concluded before the person concerned possessed inside\n          information; or\n      (b) that transaction is carried out to satisfy a legal or regulatory obligation that arose, before the person concerned\n          possessed inside information.\n      4.    For the purposes of Article 8 and 14, it shall not be deemed from the mere fact that a person is in possession of\n      inside information that that person has used that information and has thus engaged in insider dealing, where such person\n      has obtained that inside information in the conduct of a public takeover or merger with a company and uses that inside\n      information solely for the purpose of proceeding with that merger or public takeover, provided that at the point of\n      approval of the merger or acceptance of the offer by the shareholders of that company, any inside information has been\n      made public or has otherwise ceased to constitute inside information.\n      This paragraph shall not apply to stake-building.\n      5.    For the purposes of Articles 8 and 14, the mere fact that a person uses its own knowledge that it has decided to\n      acquire or dispose of financial instruments in the acquisition or disposal of those financial instruments shall not of itself\n      constitute use of inside information.\n      6.    Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 to 5 of this Article, an infringement of the prohibition of insider dealing set out in\n      Article 14 may still be deemed to have occurred if the competent authority establishes that there was an illegitimate\n      reason for the orders to trade, transactions or behaviours concerned.\n                                                                Article 10\n                                             Unlawful disclosure of inside information\n      1.    For the purposes of this Regulation, unlawful disclosure of inside information arises where a person possesses inside\n      information and discloses that information to any other person, except where the disclosure is made in the normal\n      exercise of an employment, a profession or duties.\n      This paragraph applies to any natural or legal person in the situations or circumstances referred to in Article 8(4).\n      2.    For the purposes of this Regulation the onward disclosure of recommendations or inducements referred to in\n      Article 8(2) amounts to unlawful disclosure of inside information under this Article where the person disclosing the\n      recommendation or inducement knows or ought to know that it was based on inside information.\n                                                                Article 11\n                                                            Market soundings\n      1.    A market sounding comprises the communication of information, prior to the announcement of a transaction, in\n      order to gauge the interest of potential investors in a possible transaction and the conditions relating to it such as its\n      potential size or pricing, to one or more potential investors by:\n      (a) an issuer;\n      (b) a secondary offeror of a financial instrument, in such quantity or value that the transaction is distinct from ordinary\n          trading and involves a selling method based on the prior assessment of potential interest from potential investors;\n\n\nL 173/28            EN                           Official Journal of the European Union                                        12.6.2014\n     (c) an emission allowance market participant; or\n     (d) a third party acting on behalf or on the account of a person referred to in point (a), (b) or (c).\n     2.    Without prejudice to Article 23(3), disclosure of inside information by a person intending to make a takeover bid\n     for the securities of a company or a merger with a company to parties entitled to the securities, shall also constitute a\n     market sounding, provided that:\n     (a) the information is necessary to enable the parties entitled to the securities to form an opinion on their willingness to\n         offer their securities: and\n     (b) the willingness of parties entitled to the securities to offer their securities is reasonably required for the decision to\n         make the takeover bid or merger.\n     3.    A disclosing market participant shall, prior to conducting a market sounding, specifically consider whether the\n     market sounding will involve the disclosure of inside information. The disclosing market participant shall make a written\n     record of its conclusion and the reasons therefor. It shall provide such written records to the competent authority upon\n     request. This obligation shall apply to each disclosure of information throughout the course of the market sounding. The\n     disclosing market participant shall update the written records referred to in this paragraph accordingly.\n     4.    For the purposes of Article 10(1), disclosure of inside information made in the course of a market sounding shall be\n     deemed to be made in the normal exercise of a person\u2019s employment, profession or duties where the disclosing market\n     participant complies with paragraphs 3 and 5 of this Article.\n     5.    For the purposes of paragraph 4, the disclosing market participant shall, before making the disclosure:\n     (a) obtain the consent of the person receiving the market sounding to receive inside information;\n     (b) inform the person receiving the market sounding that he is prohibited from using that information, or attempting to\n         use that information, by acquiring or disposing of, for his own account or for the account of a third party, directly or\n         indirectly, financial instruments relating to that information;\n     (c) inform the person receiving the market sounding that he is prohibited from using that information, or attempting to\n         use that information, by cancelling or amending an order which has already been placed concerning a financial\n         instrument to which the information relates; and\n     (d) inform the person receiving the market sounding that by agreeing to receive the information he is obliged to keep the\n         information confidential.\n     The disclosing market participant shall make and maintain a record of all information given to the person receiving the\n     market sounding, including the information given in accordance with points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph, and the\n     identity of the potential investors to whom the information has been disclosed, including but not limited to the legal and\n     natural persons acting on behalf of the potential investor, and the date and time of each disclosure. The disclosing market\n     participant shall provide that record to the competent authority upon request.\n     6.    Where information that has been disclosed in the course of a market sounding ceases to be inside information\n     according to the assessment of the disclosing market participant, the disclosing market participant shall inform the\n     recipient accordingly, as soon as possible.\n\n\n12.6.2014             EN                           Official Journal of the European Union                                         L 173/29\n      The disclosing market participant shall maintain a record of the information given in accordance with this paragraph and\n      shall provide it to the competent authority upon request.\n      7.     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article, the person receiving the market sounding shall assess for itself\n      whether it is in possession of inside information or when it ceases to be in possession of inside information.\n      8.     The disclosing market participant shall keep the records referred to in this Article for a period of at least five years.\n      9.     In order to ensure consistent harmonisation of this Article, ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards\n      to determine appropriate arrangements, procedures and record keeping requirements for persons to comply with the\n      requirements laid down in paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 8.\n      ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 3 July 2015.\n      Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in\n      accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n      10.      In order to ensure uniform conditions of application of this Article, ESMA shall develop draft implementing\n      technical standards to specify the systems and notification templates to be used by persons to comply with the\n      requirements established by paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 8 of this Article, particularly the precise format of the records\n      referred to in paragraphs 4 to 8 and the technical means for appropriate communication of the information referred to in\n      paragraph 6 to the person receiving the market sounding.\n      ESMA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 3 July 2015.\n      Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first\n      subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n      11.      ESMA shall issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, addressed to persons\n      receiving market soundings, regarding:\n      (a) the factors that such persons are to take into account when information is disclosed to them as part of a market\n          sounding in order for them to assess whether the information amounts to inside information;\n      (b) the steps that such persons are to take if inside information has been disclosed to them in order to comply with\n          Articles 8 and 10 of this Regulation; and\n      (c) the records that such persons are to maintain in order to demonstrate that they have complied with Articles 8 and 10\n          of this Regulation.\n                                                                  Article 12\n                                                            Market manipulation\n      1.     For the purposes of this Regulation, market manipulation shall comprise the following activities:\n      (a) entering into a transaction, placing an order to trade or any other behaviour which:\n           (i) gives, or is likely to give, false or misleading signals as to the supply of, demand for, or price of, a financial\n                instrument, a related spot commodity contract or an auctioned product based on emission allowances; or\n\n\nL 173/30             EN                            Official Journal of the European Union                                      12.6.2014\n         (ii) secures, or is likely to secure, the price of one or several financial instruments, a related spot commodity contract\n               or an auctioned product based on emission allowances at an abnormal or artificial level;\n         unless the person entering into a transaction, placing an order to trade or engaging in any other behaviour establishes\n         that such transaction, order or behaviour have been carried out for legitimate reasons, and conform with an accepted\n         market practice as established in accordance with Article 13;\n     (b) entering into a transaction, placing an order to trade or any other activity or behaviour which affects or is likely to\n         affect the price of one or several financial instruments, a related spot commodity contract or an auctioned product\n         based on emission allowances, which employs a fictitious device or any other form of deception or contrivance;\n     (c) disseminating information through the media, including the internet, or by any other means, which gives, or is likely\n         to give, false or misleading signals as to the supply of, demand for, or price of, a financial instrument, a related spot\n         commodity contract or an auctioned product based on emission allowances or secures, or is likely to secure, the price\n         of one or several financial instruments, a related spot commodity contract or an auctioned product based on emission\n         allowances at an abnormal or artificial level, including the dissemination of rumours, where the person who made the\n         dissemination knew, or ought to have known, that the information was false or misleading;\n     (d) transmitting false or misleading information or providing false or misleading inputs in relation to a benchmark where\n         the person who made the transmission or provided the input knew or ought to have known that it was false or\n         misleading, or any other behaviour which manipulates the calculation of a benchmark.\n     2.     The following behaviour shall, inter alia, be considered as market manipulation:\n     (a) the conduct by a person, or persons acting in collaboration, to secure a dominant position over the supply of or\n         demand for a financial instrument, related spot commodity contracts or auctioned products based on emission\n         allowances which has, or is likely to have, the effect of fixing, directly or indirectly, purchase or sale prices or\n         creates, or is likely to create, other unfair trading conditions;\n     (b) the buying or selling of financial instruments, at the opening or closing of the market, which has or is likely to have\n         the effect of misleading investors acting on the basis of the prices displayed, including the opening or closing prices;\n     (c) the placing of orders to a trading venue, including any cancellation or modification thereof, by any available means of\n         trading, including by electronic means, such as algorithmic and high-frequency trading strategies, and which has one\n         of the effects referred to in paragraph 1(a) or (b), by:\n           (i) disrupting or delaying the functioning of the trading system of the trading venue or being likely to do so;\n          (ii) making it more difficult for other persons to identify genuine orders on the trading system of the trading venue\n               or being likely to do so, including by entering orders which result in the overloading or destabilisation of the\n               order book; or\n         (iii) creating or being likely to create a false or misleading signal about the supply of, or demand for, or price of, a\n               financial instrument, in particular by entering orders to initiate or exacerbate a trend;\n     (d) the taking advantage of occasional or regular access to the traditional or electronic media by voicing an opinion\n         about a financial instrument, related spot commodity contract or an auctioned product based on emission allowances\n         (or indirectly about its issuer) while having previously taken positions on that financial instrument, a related spot\n         commodity contract or an auctioned product based on emission allowances and profiting subsequently from the\n         impact of the opinions voiced on the price of that instrument, related spot commodity contract or an auctioned\n         product based on emission allowances, without having simultaneously disclosed that conflict of interest to the public\n         in a proper and effective way;\n\n\n12.6.2014            EN                           Official Journal of the European Union                                          L 173/31\n      (e) the buying or selling on the secondary market of emission allowances or related derivatives prior to the auction held\n          pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 with the effect of fixing the auction clearing price for the auctioned\n          products at an abnormal or artificial level or misleading bidders bidding in the auctions.\n      3.    For the purposes of applying paragraph 1(a) and (b), and without prejudice to the forms of behaviour set out in\n      paragraph 2, Annex I defines non-exhaustive indicators relating to the employment of a fictitious device or any other\n      form of deception or contrivance, and non-exhaustive indicators related to false or misleading signals and to price\n      securing.\n      4.    Where the person referred to in this Article is a legal person, this Article shall also apply, in accordance with\n      national law, to the natural persons who participate in the decision to carry out activities for the account of the legal\n      person concerned.\n      5.    The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 35 specifying the\n      indicators laid down in Annex I, in order to clarify their elements and to take into account technical developments\n      on financial markets.\n                                                                 Article 13\n                                                       Accepted market practices\n      1.    The prohibition in Article 15 shall not apply to the activities referred to in Article 12(1)(a), provided that the person\n      entering into a transaction, placing an order to trade or engaging in any other behaviour establishes that such transaction,\n      order or behaviour have been carried out for legitimate reasons, and conform with an accepted market practice as\n      established in accordance with this Article.\n      2.    A competent authority may establish an accepted market practice, taking into account the following criteria:\n      (a) whether the market practice provides for a substantial level of transparency to the market;\n      (b) whether the market practice ensures a high degree of safeguards to the operation of market forces and the proper\n          interplay of the forces of supply and demand;\n      (c) whether the market practice has a positive impact on market liquidity and efficiency;\n      (d) whether the market practice takes into account the trading mechanism of the relevant market and enables market\n          participants to react properly and in a timely manner to the new market situation created by that practice;\n      (e) whether the market practice does not create risks for the integrity of, directly or indirectly, related markets, whether\n          regulated or not, in the relevant financial instrument within the Union;\n      (f) the outcome of any investigation of the relevant market practice by any competent authority or by another authority,\n          in particular whether the relevant market practice infringed rules or regulations designed to prevent market abuse, or\n          codes of conduct, irrespective of whether it concerns the relevant market or directly or indirectly related markets\n          within the Union; and\n      (g) the structural characteristics of the relevant market, inter alia, whether it is regulated or not, the types of financial\n          instruments traded and the type of market participants, including the extent of retail-investor participation in the\n          relevant market.\n\n\nL 173/32            EN                            Official Journal of the European Union                                      12.6.2014\n     A market practice that has been established by a competent authority as an accepted market practice in a particular\n     market shall not be considered to be applicable to other markets unless the competent authorities of those other markets\n     have accepted that practice pursuant to this Article.\n     3.    Before establishing an accepted market practice in accordance with paragraph 2, the competent authority shall\n     notify ESMA and the other competent authorities of its intention to establish an accepted market practice and shall\n     provide the details of that assessment made in accordance with the criteria laid down in paragraph 2. Such a notification\n     shall be made at least three months before the accepted market practice is intended to take effect.\n     4.    Within two months following receipt of the notification, ESMA shall issue an opinion to the notifying competent\n     authority assessing the compatibility of the accepted market practice with paragraph 2 and with the regulatory technical\n     standards adopted pursuant to paragraph 7. ESMA shall also assess whether the establishment of the accepted market\n     practice would not threaten the market confidence in the Union\u2019s financial market. The opinion shall be published on\n     ESMA\u2019s website.\n     5.    Where a competent authority establishes an accepted market practice contrary to the opinion of ESMA issued in\n     accordance with paragraph 4, it shall publish on its website within 24 hours of establishing the accepted market practice\n     a notice setting out in full its reasons for doing so, including why the accepted market practice does not threaten market\n     confidence.\n     6.    Where a competent authority considers that another competent authority has established an accepted market\n     practice that does not meet the criteria set out in paragraph 2, ESMA shall assist the authorities concerned in\n     reaching an agreement in accordance with its powers under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n     If the competent authorities concerned fail to reach an agreement, ESMA may take a decision in accordance with\n     Article 19(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n     7.    In order to ensure consistent harmonisation of this Article, ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards\n     specifying the criteria, the procedure and the requirements for establishing an accepted market practice under paragraphs\n     2, 3 and 4, and the requirements for maintaining it, terminating it, or modifying the conditions for its acceptance.\n     ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 3 July 2015.\n     Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in\n     accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n     8.    Competent authorities shall review regularly, and at least every two years, the accepted market practices that they\n     have established, in particular by taking into account significant changes to the relevant market environment, such as\n     changes to trading rules or to market infrastructures, with a view to deciding whether to maintain it, to terminate it, or to\n     modify the conditions for its acceptance.\n     9.    ESMA shall publish on its website a list of accepted market practices and in which Member States they are\n     applicable.\n     10.     ESMA shall monitor the application of accepted market practices and shall submit an annual report to the\n     Commission on how they are applied in the markets concerned.\n     11.     Competent authorities shall notify accepted market practices that they have established before 2 July 2014 to\n     ESMA within three months of the entry into force of the regulatory technical standards referred to in paragraph 7.\n\n\n12.6.2014             EN                         Official Journal of the European Union                                          L 173/33\n      The accepted market practices referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall continue to apply in the\n      Member State concerned until the competent authority has made a decision regarding the continuation of that practice\n      following ESMA\u2019s opinion under paragraph 4.\n                                                                Article 14\n                         Prohibition of insider dealing and of unlawful disclosure of inside information\n      A person shall not:\n      (a) engage or attempt to engage in insider dealing;\n      (b) recommend that another person engage in insider dealing or induce another person to engage in insider dealing; or\n      (c) unlawfully disclose inside information.\n                                                                Article 15\n                                                Prohibition of market manipulation\n      A person shall not engage in or attempt to engage in market manipulation.\n                                                                Article 16\n                                            Prevention and detection of market abuse\n      1.

Where such a person has a reasonable\n      suspicion that an order or transaction in any financial instrument, whether placed or executed on or outside a trading\n      venue, could constitute insider dealing, market manipulation or attempted insider dealing or market manipulation, the\n      person shall notify the competent authority as referred to in paragraph 3 without delay.\n      3.    Without prejudice to Article 22, persons professionally arranging or executing transactions shall be subject to the\n      rules of notification of the Member State in which they are registered or have their head office, or, in the case of a branch,\n      the Member State where the branch is situated.

The competent authorities as referred to in paragraph 3 receiving the notification of suspicious orders and trans\u00ad\n      actions shall transmit such information immediately to the competent authorities of the trading venues concerned.\n      5.

An issuer shall inform the public as soon as possible of inside information which directly concerns that issuer.\n     The issuer shall ensure that the inside information is made public in a manner which enables fast access and complete,\n     correct and timely assessment of the information by the public and, where applicable, in the officially appointed\n     mechanism referred to in Article 21 of Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and the Council (1). The\n     issuer shall not combine the disclosure of inside information to the public with the marketing of its activities. The issuer\n     shall post and maintain on its website for a period of at least five years, all inside information it is required to disclose\n     publicly.\n     This Article shall apply to issuers who have requested or approved admission of their financial instruments to trading on\n     a regulated market in a Member State or, in the case of instruments only traded on an MTF or on an OTF, issuers who\n     have approved trading of their financial instruments on an MTF or an OTF or have requested admission to trading of\n     their financial instruments on an MTF in a Member State.\n     2.     An emission allowance market participant shall publicly, effectively and in a timely manner disclose inside\n     information concerning emission allowances which it holds in respect of its business, including aviation activities as\n     specified in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC or installations within the meaning of Article 3(e) of that Directive which\n     the participant concerned, or its parent undertaking or related undertaking, owns or controls or for the operational\n     matters of which the participant, or its parent undertaking or related undertaking, is responsible, in whole or in part.\n     With regard to installations, such disclosure shall include information relevant to the capacity and utilisation of instal\u00ad\n     lations, including planned or unplanned unavailability of such installations.\n     The first subparagraph shall not apply to a participant in the emission allowance market where the installations or\n     aviation activities that it owns, controls or is responsible for, in the preceding year have had emissions not exceeding a\n     minimum threshold of carbon dioxide equivalent and, where they carry out combustion activities, have had a rated\n     thermal input not exceeding a minimum threshold.\n     The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 35 establishing a minimum\n     threshold of carbon dioxide equivalent and a minimum threshold of rated thermal input for the purposes of the\n     application of the exemption provided for in the second subparagraph of this paragraph.\n     3.     The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 35 specifying the\n     competent authority for the notifications of paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article.\n     4.     An issuer or an emission allowance market participant, may, on its own responsibility, delay disclosure to the public\n     of inside information provided that all of the following conditions are met:\n     (a) immediate disclosure is likely to prejudice the legitimate interests of the issuer or emission allowance market\n          participant;\n     (1) Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 on the harmonisation of transparency\n         requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market and amending\n         Directive 2001/34/EC (OJ L 390, 31.12.2004, p. 38).\n\n\n12.6.2014             EN                              Official Journal of the European Union                                              L 173/35\n      (b) delay of disclosure is not likely to mislead the public;\n      (c) the issuer or emission allowance market participant is able to ensure the confidentiality of that information.\n      In the case of a protracted process that occurs in stages and that is intended to bring about, or that results in, a particular\n      circumstance or a particular event, an issuer or an emission allowance market participant may on its own responsibility\n      delay the public disclosure of inside information relating to this process, subject to points (a), (b) and (c) of the first\n      subparagraph.\n      Where an issuer or emission allowance market participant has delayed the disclosure of inside information under this\n      paragraph, it shall inform the competent authority specified under paragraph 3 that disclosure of the information was\n      delayed and shall provide a written explanation of how the conditions set out in this paragraph were met, immediately\n      after the information is disclosed to the public. Alternatively, Member States may provide that a record of such an\n      explanation is to be provided only upon the request of the competent authority specified under paragraph 3.\n      5.     In order to preserve the stability of the financial system, an issuer that is a credit institution or a financial\n      institution, may, on its own responsibility, delay the public disclosure of inside information, including information\n      which is related to a temporary liquidity problem and, in particular, the need to receive temporary liquidity assistance\n      from a central bank or lender of last resort, provided that all of the following conditions are met:\n      (a) the disclosure of the inside information entails a risk of undermining the financial stability of the issuer and of the\n           financial system;\n      (b) it is in the public interest to delay the disclosure;\n      (c) the confidentiality of that information can be ensured; and\n      (d) the competent authority specified under paragraph 3 has consented to the delay on the basis that the conditions in\n           points (a), (b) and (c) are met.\n      6.     For the purposes of points (a) to (d) of paragraph 5, an issuer shall notify the competent authority specified under\n      paragraph 3 of its intention to delay the disclosure of the inside information and provide evidence that the conditions set\n      out in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 5 are met. The competent authority specified under paragraph 3 shall consult,\n      as appropriate, the national central bank or the macro-prudential authority, where instituted, or, alternatively, the\n      following authorities:\n      (a) where the issuer is a credit institution or an investment firm the authority designated in accordance with\n           Article 133(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (1);\n      (b) in cases other than those referred to in point (a), any other national authority responsible for the supervision of the\n           issuer.\n      The competent authority specified under paragraph 3 shall ensure that disclosure of the inside information is delayed only\n      for a period as is necessary in the public interest. The competent authority specified under paragraph 3 shall evaluate at\n      least on a weekly basis whether the conditions set out in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 5 are still met.\n      If the competent authority specified under paragraph 3 does not consent to the delay of disclosure of the inside\n      information, the issuer shall disclose the inside information immediately.\n      This paragraph shall apply to cases where the issuer does not decide to delay the disclosure of inside information in\n      accordance with paragraph 4.\n      (1) Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions\n          and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, amending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives\n          2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC (OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 338).\n\n\nL 173/36             EN                          Official Journal of the European Union                                       12.6.2014\n     Reference in this paragraph to the competent authority specified under paragraph 3 is without prejudice to the ability of\n     the competent authority to exercise its functions in any of the ways referred to in Article 23(1).\n     7.     Where disclosure of inside information has been delayed in accordance with paragraph 4 or 5 and the confiden\u00ad\n     tiality of that inside information is no longer ensured, the issuer or the emission allowance market participant shall\n     disclose that inside information to the public as soon as possible.\n     This paragraph includes situations where a rumour explicitly relates to inside information the disclosure of which has\n     been delayed in accordance with paragraph 4 or 5, where that rumour is sufficiently accurate to indicate that the\n     confidentiality of that information is no longer ensured.\n     8.     Where an issuer or an emission allowance market participant, or a person acting on their behalf or for their\n     account, discloses any inside information to any third party in the normal course of the exercise of an employment,\n     profession or duties as referred to in Article 10(1), they must make complete and effective public disclosure of that\n     information, simultaneously in the case of an intentional disclosure, and promptly in the case of a non-intentional\n     disclosure. This paragraph shall not apply if the person receiving the information owes a duty of confidentiality,\n     regardless of whether such duty is based on a law, on regulations, on articles of association, or on a contract.\n     9.     Inside information relating to issuers whose financial instruments are admitted to trading on an SME growth\n     market, may be posted on the trading venue\u2019s website instead of on the website of the issuer where the trading\n     venue chooses to provide this facility for issuers on that market.\n     10.      In order to ensure uniform conditions of application of this Article, ESMA shall develop draft implementing\n     technical standards to determine:\n     (a) the technical means for appropriate public disclosure of inside information as referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 8 and 9;\n          and\n     (b) the technical means for delaying the public disclosure of inside information as referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5.\n     ESMA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 3 July 2016.\n     Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first\n     subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n     11.      ESMA shall issue guidelines to establish a non-exhaustive indicative list of the legitimate interests of issuers, as\n     referred to in point (a) of paragraph 4, and of situations in which delay of disclosure of inside information is likely to\n     mislead the public as referred to in point (b) of paragraph 4.\n                                                                Article 18\n                                                               Insider lists\n     1.     Issuers or any person acting on their behalf or on their account, shall:\n     (a) draw up a list of all persons who have access to inside information and who are working for them under a contract\n          of employment, or otherwise performing tasks through which they have access to inside information, such as\n          advisers, accountants or credit rating agencies (insider list);\n     (b) promptly update the insider list in accordance with paragraph 4; and\n     (c) provide the insider list to the competent authority as soon as possible upon its request.\n\n\n12.6.2014             EN                          Official Journal of the European Union                                        L 173/37\n      2.    Issuers or any person acting on their behalf or on their account, shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that any\n      person on the insider list acknowledges in writing the legal and regulatory duties entailed and is aware of the sanctions\n      applicable to insider dealing and unlawful disclosure of inside information.\n      Where another person acting on behalf or on the account of the issuer assumes the task of drawing up and updating the\n      insider list, the issuer remains fully responsible for complying with this Article. The issuer shall always retain a right of\n      access to the insider list.\n      3.    The insider list shall include at least:\n      (a) the identity of any person having access to inside information;\n      (b) the reason for including that person in the insider list;\n      (c) the date and time at which that person obtained access to inside information; and\n      (d) the date on which the insider list was drawn up.\n      4.    Issuers or any person acting on their behalf or on their account shall update the insider list promptly, including the\n      date of the update, in the following circumstances:\n      (a) where there is a change in the reason for including a person already on the insider list;\n      (b) where there is a new person who has access to inside information and needs, therefore, to be added to the insider list;\n          and\n      (c) where a person ceases to have access to inside information.\n      Each update shall specify the date and time when the change triggering the update occurred.\n      5.    Issuers or any person acting on their behalf or on their account shall retain the insider list for a period of at least\n      five years after it is drawn up or updated.\n      6.    Issuers whose financial instruments are admitted to trading on an SME growth market shall be exempt from\n      drawing up an insider list, provided that the following conditions are met:\n      (a) the issuer takes all reasonable steps to ensure that any person with access to inside information acknowledges the\n          legal and regulatory duties entailed and is aware of the sanctions applicable to insider dealing and unlawful disclosure\n          of inside information; and\n      (b) the issuer is able to provide the competent authority, upon request, with an insider list.\n      7.    This Article shall apply to issuers who have requested or approved admission of their financial instruments to\n      trading on a regulated market in a Member State or, in the case of an instrument only traded on an MTF or an OTF, have\n      approved trading of their financial instruments on an MTF or an OTF or have requested admission to trading of their\n      financial instruments on an MTF in a Member State.\n      8.    Paragraphs 1 to 5 of this Article shall also apply to:\n      (a) emission allowance market participants in relation to inside information concerning emission allowances that arises in\n          relation to the physical operations of that emission allowance market participant;\n\n\nL 173/38            EN                           Official Journal of the European Union                                      12.6.2014\n     (b) any auction platform, auctioneer and auction monitor in relation to auctions of emission allowances or other\n         auctioned products based thereon that are held pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010.\n     9.     In order to ensure uniform conditions of application of this Article, ESMA shall develop draft implementing\n     technical standards to determine the precise format of insider lists and the format for updating insider lists referred to\n     in this Article.\n     ESMA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 3 July 2016.\n     Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first\n     subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n                                                                Article 19\n                                                        Managers\u2019 transactions\n     1.

For the purposes of paragraph 1, transactions that must be notified shall also include:\n      (a) the pledging or lending of financial instruments by or on behalf of a person discharging managerial responsibilities or\n           a person closely associated with such a person, as referred to in paragraph 1;\n      (b) transactions undertaken by persons professionally arranging or executing transactions or by another person on behalf\n           of a person discharging managerial responsibilities or a person closely associated with such a person, as referred to in\n           paragraph 1, including where discretion is exercised;\n      (c) transactions made under a life insurance policy, defined in accordance with Directive 2009/138/EC of the European\n           Parliament and of the Council (1), where:\n            (i) the policyholder is a person discharging managerial responsibilities or a person closely associated with such a\n                person, as referred to in paragraph 1,\n      (1) Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the\n          business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II) (OJ L 335, 17.12.2009, p. 1).\n\n\nL 173/40              EN                          Official Journal of the European Union                                       12.6.2014\n          (ii) the investment risk is borne by the policyholder, and\n         (iii) the policyholder has the power or discretion to make investment decisions regarding specific instruments in that\n               life insurance policy or to execute transactions regarding specific instruments for that life insurance policy.\n     For the purposes of point (a), a pledge, or a similar security interest, of financial instruments in connection with the\n     depositing of the financial instruments in a custody account does not need to be notified, unless and until such time that\n     such pledge or other security interest is designated to secure a specific credit facility.\n     Insofar as a policyholder of an insurance contract is required to notify transactions according to this paragraph, an\n     obligation to notify is not incumbent on the insurance company.\n     8.     Paragraph 1 shall apply to any subsequent transaction once a total amount of EUR 5 000 has been reached within a\n     calendar year. The threshold of EUR 5 000 shall be calculated by adding without netting all transactions referred to in\n     paragraph 1.\n     9.     A competent authority may decide to increase the threshold set out in paragraph 8 to EUR 20 000 and shall inform\n     ESMA of its decision and the justification for its decision, with specific reference to market conditions, to adopt the\n     higher threshold prior to its application. ESMA shall publish on its website the list of thresholds that apply in accordance\n     with this Article and the justifications provided by competent authorities for such thresholds.\n     10.      This Article shall also apply to transactions by persons discharging managerial responsibilities within any auction\n     platform, auctioneer and auction monitor involved in the auctions held under Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 and to\n     persons closely associated with such persons in so far as their transactions involve emission allowances, derivatives\n     thereof or auctioned products based thereon. Those persons shall notify their transactions to the auction platforms,\n     auctioneers and auction monitor, as applicable, and to the competent authority where the auction platform, auctioneer or\n     auction monitor, as applicable, is registered. The information that is so notified shall be made public by the auction\n     platforms, auctioneers, auction monitor or competent authority in accordance with paragraph 3.\n     11.      Without prejudice to Articles 14 and 15, a person discharging managerial responsibilities within an issuer shall not\n     conduct any transactions on its own account or for the account of a third party, directly or indirectly, relating to the\n     shares or debt instruments of the issuer or to derivatives or other financial instruments linked to them during a closed\n     period of 30 calendar days before the announcement of an interim financial report or a year-end report which the issuer\n     is obliged to make public according to:\n     (a) the rules of the trading venue where the issuer\u2019s shares are admitted to trading; or\n     (b) national law.\n     12.      Without prejudice to Articles 14 and 15, an issuer may allow a person discharging managerial responsibilities\n     within it to trade on its own account or for the account of a third party during a closed period as referred to in\n     paragraph 11 either:\n     (a) on a case-by-case basis due to the existence of exceptional circumstances, such as severe financial difficulty, which\n         require the immediate sale of shares; or\n     (b) due to the characteristics of the trading involved for transactions made under, or related to, an employee share or\n         saving scheme, qualification or entitlement of shares, or transactions where the beneficial interest in the relevant\n         security does not change.\n\n\n12.6.2014            EN                           Official Journal of the European Union                                        L 173/41\n      13.

Public institutions disseminating statistics or forecasts liable to have a significant effect on financial markets shall\n      disseminate them in an objective and transparent way.\n      3.    In order to ensure consistent harmonisation of this Article, ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards\n      to determine the technical arrangements for the categories of person referred to in paragraph 1, for objective presentation\n      of investment recommendations or other information recommending or suggesting an investment strategy and for\n      disclosure of particular interests or indications of conflicts of interest.\n      ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 3 July 2015.\n      Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in\n      accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n      The technical arrangements laid down in the regulatory technical standards referred to in paragraph 3 shall not apply to\n      journalists who are subject to equivalent appropriate regulation in a Member State, including equivalent appropriate self-\n      regulation, provided that such regulation achieves similar effects as those technical arrangements.

Where a competent authority is convinced that acts contrary to the provisions of this Regulation are being, or have\n      been, carried out on the territory of another Member State or that acts are affecting financial instruments traded on a\n      trading venue situated in another Member State, it shall give notice of that fact in as specific a manner as possible to the\n      competent authority of the other Member State and to ESMA and, in relation to wholesale energy products, to ACER.

The competent authority of one Member State may request assistance from the competent authority of another\n      Member State with regard to on-site inspections or investigations.\n      A requesting competent authority may inform ESMA of any request referred to in the first subparagraph. In the case of\n      an investigation or an inspection with cross-border effect, ESMA shall, if requested to do so by one of the competent\n      authorities, coordinate the investigation or inspection.\n      Where a competent authority receives a request from a competent authority of another Member State to carry out an on-\n      site inspection or an investigation, it may do any of the following:\n      (a) carry out the on-site inspection or investigation itself;\n      (b) allow the competent authority which submitted the request to participate in an on-site inspection or investigation;\n      (c) allow the competent authority which submitted the request to carry out the on-site inspection or investigation itself;\n      (d) appoint auditors or experts to carry out the on-site inspection or investigation;\n      (e) share specific tasks related to supervisory activities with the other competent authorities.\n      Competent authorities may also cooperate with competent authorities of other Member States with respect to facilitating\n      the recovery of pecuniary sanctions.\n      7.     Without prejudice to Article 258 TFEU, a competent authority whose request for information or assistance in\n      accordance with paragraphs 1, 3, 4 and 5 is not acted upon within a reasonable time or whose request for information or\n      assistance is rejected may refer that rejection or absence of action within a reasonable timeframe to ESMA.\n      In those situations, ESMA may act in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, without prejudice to\n      the possibility of ESMA acting in accordance with Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n      8.     Competent authorities shall cooperate and exchange information with relevant national and third-country regulatory\n      authorities responsible for the related spot markets where they have reasonable grounds to suspect that acts, which\n      constitute insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of information or market manipulation infringing this Regulation, are\n      being, or have been, carried out. Such cooperation shall ensure a consolidated overview of the financial and spot markets,\n      and shall detect and impose sanctions for cross-market and cross-border market abuses.\n      In relation to emission allowances, the cooperation and exchange of information provided for under the first\n      subparagraph shall also be ensured with:\n      (a) the auction monitor, with regard to auctions of emission allowances or other auctioned products based thereon that\n           are held pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010; and\n\n\nL 173/46            EN                          Official Journal of the European Union                                      12.6.2014\n     (b) competent authorities, registry administrators, including the Central Administrator, and other public bodies charged\n         with the supervision of compliance under Directive 2003/87/EC.\n     ESMA shall perform a facilitation and coordination role in relation to the cooperation and exchange of information\n     between competent authorities and regulatory authorities in other Member States and third countries.

Any confidential information received, exchanged or transmitted pursuant to this Regulation shall be subject to the\n      conditions of professional secrecy laid down in paragraphs 2 and 3.\n      2.    All the information exchanged between the competent authorities under this Regulation that concerns business or\n      operational conditions and other economic or personal affairs shall be considered to be confidential and shall be subject\n      to the requirements of professional secrecy, except where the competent authority states at the time of communication\n      that such information may be disclosed or such disclosure is necessary for legal proceedings.\n      3.    The obligation of professional secrecy applies to all persons who work or who have worked for the competent\n      authority or for any authority or market undertaking to whom the competent authority has delegated its powers,\n      including auditors and experts contracted by the competent authority. Information covered by professional secrecy\n      may not be disclosed to any other person or authority except by virtue of provisions laid down by Union or\n      national law.\n                                                                   Article 28\n                                                                Data protection\n      With regard to the processing of personal data within the framework of this Regulation, competent authorities shall carry\n      out their tasks for the purposes of this Regulation in accordance with the national laws, regulations or administrative\n      provisions transposing Directive 95/46/EC.

The competent authority of a Member State may transfer personal data to a third country provided the\n      requirements of Directive 95/46/EC are fulfilled and only on a case-by-case basis. The competent authority shall\n      ensure that the transfer is necessary for the purpose of this Regulation and that the third country does not transfer\n      the data to another third country unless it is given express written authorisation and complies with the conditions\n      specified by the competent authority of the Member State.\n      2.    The competent authority of a Member State shall only disclose personal data received from a competent authority\n      of another Member State to a supervisory authority of a third country where the competent authority of the Member\n      State concerned has obtained express agreement from the competent authority which transmitted the data and, where\n      applicable, the data is disclosed solely for the purposes for which that competent authority gave its agreement.\n      3.

Where the decision is subject to an appeal before a national judicial, administrative or other authority, competent\n     authorities shall also publish immediately on their website such information and any subsequent information on the\n     outcome of such an appeal. Moreover, any decision annulling a decision subject to appeal shall also be published.\n     3.

    "text": " One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: Arguing\nfor a Transatlantic Investor Protection Regime\n       Section 913 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Con-\n       sumer Protection Act authorized the Securities and\n       Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) to\n       promulgate a rule creating a uniform fiduciary stand-\n       ardfor all financial intermediaries. This rule would\n       harmonize regulatory standardsfor financial interme-\n       diaries in the United States but wouldfurther distance\n       the American system from the European Union's (EU)\n       Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)\n       regime. This Note argues against the uniform fiduci-\n       ary standard. Instead, the Author argues that the\n       United States and the EU should harmonize their reg-\n       ulation offinancial intermediariesto create a transat-\n       lantic investorprotection regime.\nIN TRODU CTION ................................................................................. 492\n1.

During the Dodd-Frank\nlegislative process, regulators expressed concern1 that the current\nregulatory scheme holds broker-dealers to a suitability standard while\nit holds investment advisers to the higher fiduciary standard.2 In re-\nsponse to this concern, Dodd-Frank \u00a7 913 authorized the Securities\nand Exchange Commission to promulgate a rule that would hold all\nU.S. financial intermediaries to the same higher standard of care. 3\nThe Commission staff issued its Congressionally mandated report on\nJanuary 21, 2011, indicating its intention to promulgate a rule impos-\ning a \"uniform fiduciary standard\" that will govern all financial in-\ntermediaries. 4\n          The uniform fiduciary standard will harmonize regulation of\ninvestment advisers and broker-dealers, yet increase disharmony with\nthe EU's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) re-\ngime, which regulates intermediaries based on a complex system of\nclient classification rather than intermediary classification. Instead of\ntaking one step forward and two steps back, the United States and the\nEU should pursue a transatlantic investor protection regime for the\nsecondary market under which regime issuers, intermediaries and in-\nvestors have a common set of obligations.\n           The transatlantic investor protection regime should adopt a\nmodified version of MiFID's system of customer classification, bas-\ning the standard of conduct upon the nature of the relationship be-\n       1.

According to this standard,\nthe harmonized regime should impose a fiduciary duty on discretion-\nary accounts with fee-based compensation while imposing less strin-\ngent duties on non-discretionary accounts with transaction-based\ncompensation. In addition, the transatlantic investor protection re-\ngime should place obligations on issuers to classify products for the\nbenefit of intermediaries. Finally, the regime should place harmo-\nnized obligations on investors by imposing a modified version of\nMiFID's elective professional client system.\n         Creating a transatlantic investor protection regime would\nhave three key advantages: first, by harmonizing cross-border regu-\nlation in the world's two largest investment markets, it would in-\ncrease international financial services competition, therefore decreas-\ning fees and increasing investor choice. Second, it would address the\nconcerns of uniform fiduciary standard proponents by decreasing in-\nvestor confusion and opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. Finally,\nit would address the concerns of uniform fiduciary standard oppo-\nnents by preserving legitimate broker-dealer business practices and\ninvestor access.\n         Section I will compare the investor protection regulatory\nschemes of the United States and the EU. In order to give a complete\npicture of secondary market regulation, the Author will separately\ndiscuss the corresponding obligations of intermediaries, issuers and\ninvestors. Section II will argue against the uniform fiduciary stand-\nard. It will show that although the uniform fiduciary standard will\nprovide some benefits, those benefits are overwhelmed by severe\ncosts that will result from stifling legitimate broker-dealer business\npractices and decreasing harmony with the EU. Finally, Section III\nwill propose a better alternative to the uniform fiduciary standard: a\nfully harmonized transatlantic investor protection regime. It will out-\nline the contours of a transatlantic investor protection regime that will\nsatisfy both proponents and opponents of the uniform fiduciary\nstandard. In so doing, the Author will describe the obligations that\nwill apply to all intermediaries, issuers and investors.\nI.   COMPARING THE INVESTOR PROTECTION REGIMES OF THE UNITED\n         STATES AND THE EU\n         Issuers create securities and distribute those products through\nintermediaries, who ultimately pass the securities on to investors.\nThe policy debate about investor protection in the secondary market\n\n\n                 COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNA TIONAL LAW                                 [50:490\nhas focused almost exclusively on intermediaries. 5 Intermediaries\nare the key actors in the secondary market and are best situated to\nprevent abuse; issuers and investors themselves, however, may also\nplay a role in combating abuse and creating a more successful regula-\ntory scheme. Therefore, an effective comparison of the U.S. and the\nEU regulatory regimes requires an analysis of the corresponding ob-\nligations of issuers, intermediaries and investors.\nA. Overview of the U.S. Regulatory Scheme\n          The United States uses an overlapping system of state and\nfederal regulation to govern the conduct of intermediaries. Invest-\nment advisers and broker-dealers face different regulatory require-\nments, and they must register with different agencies.\n          The anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of\n1940 (the Investment Advisers Act) impose a fiduciary duty on in-\nvestment advisers with respect to their clients. 6 Investment advisers\nmust also comply with the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Ex-\nchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and its corresponding rule\nprohibiting fraud or deceit \"in connection with the purchase or sale\nof any security.\" 7 Investment adviser firms and their registered rep-\nresentatives must register with the SEC if their net assets meet a cer-\ntain threshold; if they fall below that threshold, investment advisers\nmust instead register with the state in which they are located.8\n          The Investment Advisers Act exempts broker-dealers from\nthe jurisdiction of the Act. 9 The Exchange Act requires broker-\n      5.

U.S. Regulatory Scheme: Obligations on Intermediaries\n          The subsections below outline the different regulatory re-\ngimes governing broker-dealers and investment advisers. Broker-\ndealers and investment advisers share many of the same obligations;\nthe key difference is that investment advisers must discharge a fidu-\nciary duty to clients, whereas broker-dealers need only discharge a\nsuitability duty.\n 1. Investment Advisers\n          Investment advisers in the United States typically manage\ndiscretionary, fee-based investment accounts for clients. 15 Invest-\nment advisers often act as financial planners for their clients and, un-\nlike broker-dealers, cannot freely sell securities on a principal basis\nfrom their own accounts.1 6 Instead, investment advisers must act on\nbehalf of their clients by placing orders with broker-dealers.\n          The Investment Advisers Act, the Exchange Act and state\nU.S.C. \u00a7 80b-2 (2006).\n     10.

First and\nmost importantly, the Supreme Court of the United States has inter-\npreted the Investment Advisers Act to impose a federal fiduciary\n standard on investment advisers. 1\" The fiduciary standard encom-\npasses the duties of loyalty and care.18 The duty of loyalty requires\nthe investment adviser to act in \"the best interests of its clients,\nwhich includes an obligation not to subordinate the clients' interests\nto its own.\" \" The investment adviser must eliminate, or at least fully\ndisclose, any material conflicts of interest in order to comply with his\nduty of loyalty.2 \u00b0 The duty of care requires the investment adviser to\nmake a \"reasonable investigation\" to ensure his recommendations\nare not based on \"materially inaccurate or incomplete infor-\nmation.\"\" In order to comply with this duty, investment advisers\nmust make a reasonable investigation into their clients' needs and ob-\njectives, and provide only \"suitable\" investment advice.22\n           Investment advisers' obligations under the Investment Advis-\ners Act do not end with the fiduciary duty. Two of the most im-\nportant regulations include the duty of best execution and the re-\n strictions on principal and cross trading.23 Although the investment\nadviser does not typically execute trades himself, the duty of best ex-\necution requires him to select a broker-dealer who will provide the\nbest trade execution for his client.24 The restrictions on principal and\ncross trading in the Investment Advisers Act recognize the especially\nacute conflicts of interest inherent in those transaction types.2 5 In-\nvestment advisers must give written disclosure26 and get written con-\n     17.

U.S. Regulatory Scheme: Obligations on Issuers\n         The Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\") and the Ex-\nchange Act impose disclosure-based obligations on issuers with re-\nspect to the issuance of securities. The Securities Act requires issuers\nto disclose financial and other information about their companies and\nthe securities they are issuing. 59 In addition, the Securities Act en-\nsures the veracity of this information by prohibiting deceit and mis-\nrepresentation.6' The Exchange Act imposes ongoing corporate re-\nporting requirements on issuers with more than 10 million dollars in\nassets whose securities are held by more than 500 people. 61 Like the\nSecurities Act, the Exchange Act uses antifraud provisions to ensure\nthe veracity of company-disclosed information.62\n         After companies have issued securities in the United States,\nintermediaries have access to the full menu of publicly disclosed in-\nformation mandated by the Securities Act and Exchange Act. How-\never, the legal obligations of issuers to intermediaries end there. In-\ntermediaries must make \"suitability\"                         or \"best interests\"\ndeterminations for their customers based on their analysis of whatev-\ner information has been disclosed.6 3 However, U.S. laws do not re-\nquire issuers to work with intermediaries on these determinations or\nprovide recommendations about what kinds of customers are best\nsuited for the securities that they issue.\nD.

EU Regulatory Scheme: Obligationson Intermediaries\n          MiFID imposes obligations on intermediaries based on a\ncomplex customer categorization system. There are four customer\ncategories under MiFID, each with a different level of protection: re-\ntail clients, elective professional clients, per se professional clients\nand eligible counter-parties (ECPs). 73 ECPs include only the largest\nand most sophisticated institutional investors.7 4 Per se professionals\nare investors who are not ECPs, but meet a defined threshold of size,\nsophistication and/or experience. 7' All other investors are retail cli-\nents by default. 76\n          In some circumstances, investors may elect to change cus-\ntomer categories. Retail clients may opt up to elective professional\nstatus, thus waiving certain protections attached to retail client sta-\ntus. 77 Similarly, per se and elective professional investors may opt\ndown to retail client status, thus gaining extra protections.7 8 Clients\nmay opt up or down for all services, or they may elect to do so only\nin respect to particular products or transactions.79\n          MiFID imposes business obligations on intermediaries that\nvary in accordance with client category.8\" First, intermediaries must\n    71.

EU Regulatory Scheme: Obligationson Issuers\n          The EU places disclosure-based obligations on issuers. The\nProspectus Directive requires the issuer to disclose certain infor-\nmation about the firm and about the security it is issuing, including\nits \"essential risks and characteristics.\" 93 The Prospectus Directive\nexempts certain kinds of issuances from regulation,9 4 but the exemp-\ntions do not affect most large issuances that end up in the secondary\nmarket. Like the United States, the EU does not impose any special\nobligations on issuers to disclose the suitability or appropriateness of\ntheir products for different kinds of customers, placing most of the\nburden on intermediaries.\nH. EU Regulatory Scheme: Obligationson Investors\n          Unlike the U.S. system, MiFID explicitly places certain duties\non sophisticated investors, alleviating the burden on intermediaries.\nFirst, MiFID places burdens on investors with respect to accurate\ninformed that the intermediary will not conduct a suitability determination and have its\ncorresponding protections. Article 19(6) reiterates, however, that the intermediary must still\ncomply with its conflict of interest obligations under MiFID Directive, supra note 68,\nDirective 2004/39, art. 18.\n    89. MiFID Directive, supra note 68, Directive 2004/39, art. 18.

The Problem: The Uniform FiduciaryStandardDecreases\n           Harmony with the EU System and Threatens Legitimate\n           Broker-DealerBusiness Models\n            Section 9139' of Dodd-Frank authorizes the Commission to\nconduct a study (the 913 Study) and promulgate a rule establishing a\nuniform fiduciary standard for intermediaries who provide personal-\nized investment advice 98 about securities to retail investors. 99 The\n    95. See Kruithof & Van Gerven, supra note 70, at 13-14; see also MiFID Directive,\nsupra note 68, Directive 2004/39, Annex 11(2). MiFID does not require the intermediary to\nmake any additional investigations after he has classified a customer as an elective\nprofessional client. However, if the intermediary becomes aware that the client no longer\nmeets the necessary qualifications, he must reclassify the customer. Kruithof & Van\nGerven, supra note 70, at 14.\n    96. See supra notes 83, 87 and accompanying text. MiFID effectively shifts part of the\nsuitability determination to elective professional customers, an even greater part of the\nsuitability determination to per se professional customers and all of the appropriateness\ndetermination to professional customers. Moreover, MiFID shifts all the burden to clients\nfor certain kinds of execution-only transactions when certain conditions are met. See supra\nnote 88 and accompanying text.\n    97.

See 913\nSTUDY,   supra note 4, at 123. The extent to which the \"personalized investment advice\"\nlanguage will limit the imposition of the uniform fiduciary standard is still unclear. SEC\nCommissioner Luis Aguilar summed up this uncertainty when he said, \"I question why [the\nfiduciary standard] should be limited to 'personalized services.' This qualification would\nnarrow the range of clients that would be protected by the fiduciary standard, and I fear that\nit may become a loophole that would make it easy to avoid putting clients first.\" Aguilar\nSpeech 1,supra note 1.\n    99.

Next, they will describe\nseveral disadvantages of the uniform fiduciary standard and argue\nthat the substantial disadvantages merit pursuing a different ap-\nproach.\nB. Advantages of the Uniform FiduciaryStandard\n            The 913 Study authors made well-founded arguments regard-\ning the benefits of a uniform fiduciary standard. First, the uniform\nfiduciary standard would reduce investor confusion.0 4                             The 913\nStudy presented survey results showing that most investors do not\npossibility that the Commission may include other kinds of investors (such as institutional\ninvestors) within the unifonn fiduciary standard. Dodd-Frank \u00a7 913(g) amends the\nExchange Act to authorize the SEC to:\n        promulgate rules to provide that, with respect to a broker or dealer, when\n        providing personalized investment advice about securities to a retail customer\n        (and such other customers as the Commission may by rule provide), the\n        standard of conduct for such broker or dealer with respect to such customer\n        shall be the same as the standard of conduct applicable to an investment adviser\n        under section 211 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o(k) (Supp. 2011) (emphasis added). At least one Commissioner has\nexpressed interest in applying the uniform fiduciary standard to all investors. \" question\nwhy the protection of the fiduciary standard should be limited to 'retail' customers ... all\ninvestors, including institutional investors, need the protection of the fiduciary standard.\"\nAguilar Speech 1, supra note 1.\n    100.

Promulgating a uniform fiduciary\nstandard rule would eliminate this loophole and level the playing\nfield for investment advisers.           1\"0\n           Finally, and less persuasively, the Commission argues that the\nuniform fiduciary standard would preserve investor access to the full\nmenu of broker-dealer services that they currently enjoy.\"' While it\nis true that the uniform fiduciary standard would be less disruptive\nthan other alternatives that the Commission considered,112 the Com-\n    105.

Two important caveats apply. First, some state laws already impose a fiduciary\nduty on broker-dealers under certain circumstances.           See supra notes 52-54 and\naccompanying text. Second, in some areas broker-dealers actually have higher regulatory\ncosts than investment advisers, including continuing education and competency\nrequirements. See 913 STUDY, supra note 4, at 164. However, the 913 Study recommends\nconsidering the harmonization of these requirements as well. Id. at 165-66.\n    111.   Id. at 165.\n    112. Removing the broker-dealer exclusion from the Investment Advisers Act would\nimpose an even greater burden on broker-dealer business practices because it would subject\nbroker-dealers to provisions like \u00a7 206(3), which places restrictions on principal trading.\nSee Investment Advisers Act of 1940 \u00a7 206(3), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-6 (2006); id. at 146-5 1.\n\n\n                  COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNA TIONAL LAW                            [50:490\nmission takes an overly optimistic view of the compatibility of the\nfiduciary standard with broker-dealer business models.113\nC. Disadvantagesof the Uniform FiduciaryStandard\n           A uniform fiduciary standard would have two serious disad-\nvantages: first, it would stifle legitimate broker-dealer business mod-\nels, and second, it would decrease regulatory harmony with the EU.\nAs discussed in more detail below, this result would raise costs for\ninvestors, decrease investor choice and increase confusion at the in-\nternational level.\n1. The Uniform Fiduciary Standard Stifles Broker-Dealer Business\n           Models\n           Broker-dealers engage in many legitimate business practices\nthat fundamentally clash with the requirements of the fiduciary duty.\nUsing non-discretionary accounts with transaction-based compensa-\ntion, underwriting, principal trading and execution-only transactions\nwould all become endangered practices if the Commission imposes a\nfiduciary duty on broker-dealers. Yet these practices increase liquidi-\nty and provide significant cost advantages to investors.114 The fol-\nlowing subsections will describe the broker-dealer business practices\nthat would be threatened by a uniform fiduciary standard and explain\nhow they contribute to liquidity and cost reduction.\na. Transaction-BasedCompensation\n           Transaction-based compensation and non-discretionary ac-\ncounts are core features of most broker-dealer businesses. 115 Trans-\naction-based compensation incentivizes broker-dealers to execute as\nmany trades as possible\" 6 and to prefer trades that incur higher\n    113.   See discussion infi-a Part I.CI.\n    114. See, e.g., Letter from Marc Menchel, Executive Vice President and General\nCounsel, FINRA, to Elizabeth M. Murphy, Secretary, SEC (Aug. 25, 2010) (available at\nhttp://www.sec.gov/comments/4-606/4606-1924.pdf) [hereinafter FINRA Letter].\n    115. See supra note 35 and accompanying text.\n    116. When done to a fraudulent extent, this practice is known as \"churning\" and gives\nrise to an action for fraud under \u00a7 10(b) of the Exchange Act. \"Churning occurs when a\nsecurities broker enters into transactions and manages a client's account for the purpose of\ngenerating commissions and in disregard of his client's interests.\" Miley v. Oppenheimer &\nCo., 637 F.2d 318, 324 (5th Cir. 1981).\n\n\n2012]                  TRANSATLANTIC INVESTOR PROTECTION\nmarkups.117 This compensation structure works well with non-\ndiscretionary accounts because the intermediary must obtain consent\nbefore executing trades; the broker-dealer's lack of discretion acts as\na check on his natural incentives to trade more.\n           Principal-agent theory supports matching transaction-based\ncompensation and non-discretionary accounts. ' Although the bro-\nker-dealer does not act as a fiduciary, the investor (the \"principal\")\nhas significant         control over the actions of the broker-dealer (the\n\"agent\"). \"9 Conversely, discretionary accounts match best with fee-\nbased compensation and a fiduciary duty. The fee-based compensa-\ntion structure removes the incentive to \"chum,\" 12 0 and the fiduciary\nduty keeps the agent's discretion in check. 121\n           A fundamental mismatch between incentives and duties arises\nwhen a transaction-based compensation, non-discretionary account\ncombines with a fiduciary duty or when a fee-based compensation,\ndiscretionary account lacks a fiduciary duty. However, the uniform\nfiduciary standard would give rise to the former situation, notwith-\n    117.   Less liquid securities will have higher execution costs and therefore give rise to\nhigher commissions.

This remains a far cry from the paradigm case for imposing heightened duties: the\ninvestment adviser that has discretionary authority over the client's funds.\" Moloney et al.,\nFiduciaryDuties, Broker-Dealersand Sophisticated Clients: A Mis-Match That Could Only\nBe Made in Washington, 3 J.

The intermediary will simply increase costs to himself if he trades excessively\nbecause he will not be able to pass on the costs to the customer as he would in a\ncommission-based account. Fee-based accounts still pose the danger of \"reverse churning,\"\nhowever, in which the intermediary intentionally under-trades to the detriment of the client\nin order to keep his costs down.

Even if broker-\ndealers were capable of suppressing natural competitive incentives,\ndissatisfied clients will bring suits for breach of fiduciary duty when\ntrades go bad, arguing that the broker-dealer traded too much. 23                     ' This\nincrease in litigation would lead more broker-dealers to shift to fee-\nbased compensation, 124 where incentives are naturally compatible\nwith a fiduciary duty. Such a shift would decrease the supply of in-\ntermediaries who provide transaction-based compensation, leading to\nincreased costs for these services and hurting investors whose                     12 5     in-\nvestment objectives require transaction-based compensation.\nb.

The study found that a uniform fiduciary standard would\nlead to broker-dealers shifting to fee-based compensation and would cause serious\nconsequences for retail investors. First, the study predicted that such a shift would lead to a\nreduction of \"cumulative returns to 'small investor' [clients] by S20K over the next 20\nyears.\" Id. at 26. The study noted that the average lower-income investor tends to trade\ninfrequently and therefore prefers commission-based accounts, finding that over 90% of\nlower-income investors use only commission-based accounts. Such a shift to fee-based\ncompensation would hit lower-income investors the hardest. Id.\n    126.

During the\nbook-building process, underwriters seek nonbinding bids from institutional and retail\nclients, where they find out how many shares the clients want and how much they would\npay. The IPOs become oversubscribed because underwriters must seek bids from far more\npotential investors than necessary in order to aid price discovery and ensure a favorably\npriced sale of all the newly issued shares. This results in a \"25-to-I ratio\": for every\nmillion shares issued at the offering price, 25 million investors expressed interest in that\nprice. Id. Importantly, these practices benefit investors by providing discounted offering\nprices: \"[i]n the period from 1980 to 2001, the offering price was set on average at 18.8%\nbelow the market-clearing price.\" Id. at 46 (citation omitted).\n    128. The underwriter might award long-standing clients with access to hard-to-get IPO\nofferings or distribute shares to institutional clients with the hope of receiving additional\nbusiness in the future.

If a broker-dealer's clients flip too quickly, the underwriter\nmight penalize the offending broker-dealer by taking back commissions or withholding\nfuture issuances. Id. at 46. This may ultimately cause broker-dealers to give preference to\ninstitutional investors, who receive about two-thirds of IPO shares, because broker-dealers\ntend to believe that they are more likely to exhibit \"strong hand\" behavior. Id. at 45. This\nalso causes broker-dealers to prefer clients with long-term investing objectives and may also\ncause broker-dealers to discourage clients from selling shares.

Principal trading benefits investors by lowering execution costs and increasing\naccess to certain types of securities. See in/ra notes 137, 138 and accompanying text. A\nbroker-dealer also serves his own interests by engaging in principal trading, however, by\nselling from his own account instead of simply acting as an agent for the client.

Execution-Only Transactionswith IncidentalAdvice\n           Broker-dealers often execute transactions at their customers'\nrequests and provide only incidental advice in relation to the transac-\ntion.' 42 The proposed uniform fiduciary standard would not cover\n    137. Intermediaries increase liquidity for issuers when they buy large quantities of\nsecurities and hold them before they are ready for distribution to investors. Id. If the\namount of principal trading decreased, the transaction costs of bringing new issuances to\nmarket would increase, ultimately passing higher costs onto consumers.\n    138. \"Bunching,\" or buying securities in bulk for the principal account, allows the\nbroker-dealer to consolidate his execution costs into a single transaction and then pass those\nexecution savings on to his clients. 913 STUDY, supra note 4, at 29. This is especially true\nfor illiquid securities where execution costs are high, such as investment grade corporate\ndebt. Id. at 160 n.694. If broker-dealers choose instead to execute each transaction\nseparately and avoid the conflicts of interest inherent in bunching, see id. at 29, execution\ncosts would increase dramatically, and many illiquid securities would become unaffordable\nto lower-income investors. This would not only hit individual investors-who are the\nprimary holders of corporate and municipal debt-but would also hurt municipalities who\nrely on cheap financing. See WYMAN, supra note 125, at 15-21.\n    139. Broker-dealers try to predict retail demand when they amass inventory on their\nprincipal accounts. Id. at 21. It would be unrealistic, however, to expect broker-dealers to\nanticipate their current and future clients' needs such that they could only purchase\ninventory which is in the \"best interests\" of every single client and not merely \"suitable.\"\nMoreover, the savings in execution costs and increase in investor access to bonds are very\nmuch in the investors' \"best interests.\"\n    140.

However, the costs of a uniform fiduciary standard do not\nend there.

The Uniform Fiduciary Standard Decreases Harmony with the\n          EU\n          The suitability standard is the key similarity between the\nUnited States' and the EU's regulatory regimes. 146 This similarity\nwould disappear with the imposition of a uniform fiduciary standard\nin the United States.

See id.; see also FINRA Letter, supra note 114.\n    146. To the extent that intermediaries in the EU may act as broker-dealers for U.S.\ncustomers, they share the suitability standard.        Of course, to the extent that EU\nintermediaries fall within the definition of \"investment adviser\" under the Investment\nAdvisers Act, they would be subject to the fiduciary duty. See Investment Advisers Act of\n1940 \u00a7 206(a)(11), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-2(a)(11) (2006) (\"'Investment adviser' means any\nperson who, for compensation, engages in the business of advising others, either directly or\nthrough publications or writings, as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of\ninvesting in, purchasing, or selling securities.\").\n\n\n2012]                TRANSATLANTIC INVESTOR PROTECTION\nalready stark14 would become insuperable.\n          Decreasing regulatory harmony between the United States\nand the EU would have several consequences that would ultimately\nresult in higher costs and fewer choices for investors. First, firms\nthat wish to operate in both jurisdictions would need to maintain two\nentirely different systems with respect to compliance, supervision\nand training.148 Firms that cannot afford two systems would confine\nthemselves to their home market, decreasing cross-border investment\nfirm competition; firms that can afford two systems would pass on\nhigher regulatory costs to consumers. Whether firms withdraw or\npass on higher fees, the net result would be higher costs and fewer\nchoices for investors. Second, raising barriers to cross-border inter-\nmediary activity would aggravate the \"home bias\" ' of investors.\nInvestors would be limited to investment services from intermediar-\nies in their home market, losing the benefits of cross-border flows of\nproducts and information. Home bias ultimately results in subopti-\nmal investment strategies, \u00b0 and investors in both the United States\nand the EU already suffer from significant home bias.15 Finally, de-\ncreasing regulatory harmony between the United States and the EU\nwould cause ripple effects throughout both economies that would\nhurt consumers. For example, less cross-border investment would\nmean fewer liquid markets for issuers. In order to distribute their\nproducts, issuers would need to allow intermediaries to take higher\n    147.  Examples of key differences include the appropriateness standard in the EU, see\nsupra notes 86-87 and accompanying text, the execution-only standard in the EU, see supra\nnote 88 and accompanying text, and the fiduciary standard for investment advisers in the\nUnited States, see supra notes 17-22 and accompanying text.\n    148. Only large firms would have the necessary economies of scale to be able to afford\nsuch a dual system. Of course, international firms already need to do this but not to the\nextent that would be required if there were a uniform fiduciary standard in the United States.\n    149. Financial theory predicts that investors would \"hold the world market portfolio of\nrisky assets, irrespective of their country of residence\" in order to maximize returns;\nnotwithstanding this principle, investors skew strongly towards domestic holdings, creating a\nparadoxical \"home bias.\"     Alan G.

ALTERNATIVES TO THE UNIFORM FIDUCIARY STANDARD\nA. The Solution: Proposalfor a TransatlanticInvestor Protection\n         Regime\n         The bifurcated regulation in the United States weakens inves-\ntor protection. Yet the uniform fiduciary standard provides a cure\nworse than the disease by raising costs and decreasing choice for in-\nvestors. Regulators do not need to choose between protection and\ncost, however; instead, a harmonized transatlantic investor protection\nregime could satisfy the concerns of both proponents and opponents\nof the uniform fiduciary duty.\n         Why harmonize the regimes? First, increased cross-border\nregulatory harmony means greater investment firm competition, less\nhome bias and more cross-border liquidity, ultimately resulting in\nlower costs and greater choice for investors. 153 Second, the United\nStates can close the loopholes inherent in its current system by shift-\ning away from an intermediary classification approach and toward a\ncustomer classification approach, which would result in greater har-\nmony with MiFID. 154 Third, shifting to customer classification in the\nUnited States would preserve legitimate broker-dealer business prac-\ntices without sacrificing meaningful protection for unsophisticated\nretail investors. By focusing on client classification and the nature of\nthe relationship between the investor and the intermediary, the United\nStates and the EU can harmonize their regimes and increase both pro-\ntection and efficiency.\n    152.

The Harmonized TransatlanticInvestor ProtectionRegime\n          The following sections will outline a proposal for a harmo-\nnized transatlantic investor protection regime, describing the obliga-\ntions that should be imposed on intermediaries, issuers and investors.\nEach section will explain how the proposed approach would satisfy\nthe concerns of both proponents and opponents of the uniform fiduci-\nary standard. First, this Note discusses obligations on intermediaries,\narguing that the United States should eliminate intermediary catego-\nry-based regulation and adopt MiFID's customer classification\nscheme. Second, the Note argues that the obligations imposed on in-\ntermediaries should be based upon the nature of the relationship be-\ntween the investor and the intermediary; the level of the intermedi-\nary's discretion and the compensation structure define this\nrelationship. Third, the Note discusses obligations on issuers, argu-\ning that the United States and the EU should shift away from their\npurely disclosure-based models and require issuers to provide infor-\nmation to intermediaries on the suitability of their products for differ-\nent kinds of investors. Finally, the Note discusses investor obliga-\ntions, arguing that the United States should adopt a modified version\nof the EU's elective professional client regime. If the United States\nand the EU took these steps, they would enjoy the benefits of a fully\nharmonized investor protection regime.\n 1. Obligations on Intermediaries\n          The United States's and the EU's regulation of intermediaries\noverlap in several areas. 55     ' The regimes differ, however, in two key\nareas. First, the United States uses an intermediary category-based\nregulation approach while the EU uses a client category-based regu-\nlation approach.' 5 6 Second, the basic duty owed to clients differs. 15\nThe United States and the EU must agree on common standards in\nthese two key areas in order to achieve meaningful harmonization.\nThe following sub-sections will describe how the United States and\nthe EU can harmonize these two areas while addressing the concerns\nof both proponents and opponents of the uniform fiduciary duty.\n   155. Among other examples, both regimes require conflicts of interest disclosure, and\nboth prohibit false and misleading advertising and communications. See discussion supra\nParts IC, I.G.\n   156.   See discussion supra Parts I.C, I.G.\n   157.   See discussion supra Parts IC, I.G.\n\n\n                  COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNA TIONAL LAW                               [50:490\na. Eliminate IntermediaryCategory-BasedRegulation and\n           Standardize Client Category-BasedRegulation\n           Intermediary category-based regulation causes investor con-\nfusion and creates regulatory loopholes. Client category-based regu-\nlation, on the other hand, creates a system of proportional regulation\nin which the level of regulatory burden depends upon the size, so-\nphistication and experience of the client. 158 The United States should\nadopt MiFID's customer classification system in order to harmonize\nthe regimes and address the concerns of both proponents and oppo-\nnents of the uniform fiduciary standard.\n           Switching to customer category-based regulation would ad-\ndress uniform fiduciary proponents' concerns. Intermediary catego-\nry-based regulation caused investor confusion and regulatory loop-\nholes because broker-dealers could essentially provide the same\nservices to the same clients as investment advisers, without being                            59\nsubject to the same fiduciary duty as investment advisers would be. 1\nCustomer category-based regulation ensures that all intermediaries\nmust discharge the same duties when providing the same services to\nthe same clients.160 This not only eliminates possibilities for regula-\ntory arbitrage, but also provides a much clearer picture for retail in-\nvestors. A retail investor would always enjoy the same protection\nwhile receiving investment advice, unless she chose to become an\nelective professional client. Given the qualifications required and\nprocess involved in becoming an elective professional client, 161 it is\nunlikely that such clients would be confused when they receive elec-\ntive professional client status.\n           Switching to a customer category-based regulation regime\nwould also address the concerns of uniform fiduciary standard oppo-\nnents, to the extent that it carves out exemptions from the fiduciary\nduty and therefore preserves legitimate broker-dealer business mod-\n    158.   MiFID aims to achieve proportionalitythrough \"business rules [that] differentiate\nin their application between several types of clients that require different forms and intensity\nof protection.\" Kruithof& Van Gerven, supra note 70, at 3-4.\n    159.   See Aguilar Speech 1, supra note 1.\n    160. In other words, under MiFID an intermediary must discharge the suitability duty\nwhen it provides investment advice to a retail client, regardless of what kind of intermediary\nis providing the advice. The duty only changes when the type of client or type of transaction\nchanges. See discussion supra Part I.G.\n    161.   The process is initiated by the investor and requires meaningful disclosures on the\npart of both the investor and the intermediary. See discussion supra Part I.G.\n\n\n2012]                TRANSATLANTIC INVESTOR PROTECTION\nels. 16 2 Even if the harmonized standard were to impose a fiduciary\nduty with respect to retail investors under certain circumstances,163\nthe harmonized standard might impose a lower duty with respect to\nelective professional and per se professional clients and may also im-\npose a lower duty with respect to certain kinds of non-discretionary\ntransactions. 164 In these areas, where the fiduciary standard does not\napply, broker-dealers would still be able to engage in crucial practic-\nes like transaction-based compensation, underwriting and principal\ntrading. 65' In other words, intermediaries would still be able to en-\ngage in broker-dealer business practices when appropriate and would\nonly be precluded from doing so where the nature of the client or\ntransaction makes a fiduciary duty necessary.\n          Even if the United States and the EU harmonize their regimes\nby eliminating intermediary-based regulation and adopting MiFID's\ncustomer category-based regulation, three important questions re-\nmain: (1) what duty would be owed, (2) to which clients and (3) un-\nder what circumstances? The next section argues that those questions\nshould be answered by focusing on the nature of the relationship be-\ntween the investor and the intermediary. This approach should satis-\nfy both proponents and opponents of the uniform fiduciary standard.\nb. Harmonize Duties Owed to Investors Based Upon the Nature of\n          the Relationship\n          There are two key components of the relationship between\ninvestors and intermediaries: the level of discretion and the compen-\nsation structure. Discretion matters because an intermediary with\ndiscretion enjoys a trust-based relationship with the investor while an\nintermediary without discretion does not. 16 6 Compensation structure\nmatters because it creates strong incentives to engage in certain trad-\ning behaviors.' 6 7 Regulators should match intermediary discretion\nwith compensation structure in order to align intermediary duties\nwith trading incentives.168 The United States and the EU can align\nduties with incentives by crafting a regime that (1) matches discre-\n   162.

The following sections will describe how the\nUnited States and the EU could accomplish this alignment and why it\nwould satisfy the concerns of both proponents and opponents of the\nuniform fiduciary standard.\ni.    Discretion\n           The United States and the EU have different approaches to\ndiscretion. In the United States, the broad trend has been to impose a\nfiduciary duty on discretionary relationships and a suitability duty on\nnon-discretionary relationships. 6 9 A problem arose when intermedi-\nary category-based regulation led to a breakdown of this distinction,\nin which broker-dealers could enjoy considerable discretion, yet\navoid the fiduciary duty. 70 In the EU, by contrast, the highest level\nof discretion in the intermediary-investor relationship mandates the\nsuitability standard. 7 ' A somewhat lower level of discretion gives\nrise to the appropriateness standard, 17 2 and no discretion at all re-\nmoves the conduct of business standard entirely. \"3\n           The United States and the EU should harmonize their stand-\nards by imposing a fiduciary duty on discretionary relationships with\nretail investors and lesser duties with respect to non-discretionary re-\nlationships and non-retail investors. Three reasons militate in favor\nof such a harmonized standard. First, doing so would not cause a\nmajor disruption in either system. The United States already imposes\na fiduciary duty on discretionary relationships with retail investors,\nand the EU's conduct of business obligations, when read together, al-\nready come close to imposing such a duty.1 14 Second, as uniform fi-\n    169.

It is important to note that judges in some EU\ncountries have already read fiduciary aspects into the intermediary-investor relationship\nthrough MiFID Directive Article 19(1)'s requirement that intermediaries act in the \"best\ninterests\" of investors.

Seesupra note 171.\n\n\n2012]                 TRANSATLANTIC INVESTOR PROTECTION\nduciary proponents have rightly argued, the fiduciary duty is an im-\nportant form of protection for vulnerable retail investors in trust-\nbased relationships.1\"5 Third, avoiding a fiduciary duty for non-\ndiscretionary relationships and non-retail clients will preserve a\nmeaningful space for legitimate broker-dealer      176            business practices\nwithout sacrificing investor protection.\n          Setting the standard for non-discretionary relationships is\nmore challenging. The United States has generally set the suitability\nstandard as a floor for intermediaries, whereas the EU allows for\nlesser duties under certain circumstances. The U.S. regime already\nrecognizes, however, that the suitability standard is inappropriate\nwith respect to designated investors; 177 switching to the EU's para-\ndigm of suitability, appropriateness and execution-only would not,\ntherefore, cause a sea change in the type of protection afforded to in-\nvestors. Although doing so would impose one-time transition\ncosts, 178 the United States should adopt the EU's approach with re-\nspect to non-discretionary relationships.\nii. Compensation Structure\n          The United States and the EU take different approaches to\ncompensation structure, but neither regime explicitly recognizes that\ncertain compensation structures should give rise to certain duties. In\nthe United States, regulation typically matches the fiduciary duty\nwith fee-based compensation and the suitability duty with transac-\ntion-based compensation. 17 However, this was not always the\ncase18 \u00b0 and would certainly not be the case under the uniform fiduci-\nary duty.' 8 ' The EU, on the other hand, focuses mainly on conflicts\nof interest disclosure and mitigation but does not prescribe a particu-\n   175.   See discussion supra Part IIB; see also MiFID 2.0, supra note 71, at 135-36.\n   176.   See discussion supra Part I.C. 1.\n   177. See FINRA, NASD RULE 2310 (1990) (exempting institutional and high-net-worth\ninvestors from the suitability standard).\n   178.   Although U.S. firms would incur one-time costs of switching to a customer\ncategory-based system, such costs might be offset by a long-term decrease in regulatory\ncosts with respect to non-retail investors.\n   179.   See discussion supra Part I.C.\n   180. Although such situations are relatively rare, some broker-dealers charge fees, and\nsome investment advisers charge commissions. See 913 STUDY, supra note 4, at 7-11.\n   181. Dodd-Frank emphasized that broker-dealers would still be able to use transaction-\nbased compensation structures under a fiduciary duty. See supranote 122.\n\n\n               COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNA TIONAL LAW            [50:490\nlar compensation structure. \"'\n        The United States and the EU should recognize that fee-based\ncompensation matches the fiduciary duty and transaction-based com-\npensation does not. Failing to recognize this connection leads to a\nfundamental mismatch of incentives and duties.' 83 By matching in-\ncentives and duties, the transatlantic investor regime could ensure\nthat vulnerable investors will be protected while preserving legiti-\nmate broker-dealer business practices.184\n        As a result, discretionary relationships should have fee-based\ncompensation, while non-discretionary relationships should have\ntransaction-based compensation. The former would benefit from im-\nposing fiduciary duties while the latter could not. Instead, MiFID's\nregime of suitability, appropriateness and execution-only transactions\nshould govern non-discretionary, transaction-based relationships.\nAdopting this harmonized standard would incur one-time costs for\nboth U.S. and EU intermediaries. However, these one-time costs\nshould be more18 5than offset by the long-run benefits of cross-border\nharmonization.\n        Harmonization efforts must necessarily focus on intermediar-\nies because they are the main conduit for securities in the secondary\nmarket and are best situated to protect investors. A transatlantic in-\nvestor protection regime would gain additional strength, however, by\npursuing further harmonization with respect to issuers and investors.\nThe final subsections will describe how the United States and the EU\ncan take moderate steps to harmonize these obligations.\nC. Obligationson Issuers\n        Although the majority of harmonization must take place with\nrespect to intermediaries, the United States and the EU can improve\nsecondary market regulation by requiring issuers to play a meaning-\nful role in classifying products for particular customer categories.\nThe United States and the EU should move beyond disclosure-based\nobligations and require issuers to work with intermediaries on classi-\nfying products so that intermediaries can make more accurate rec-\nommendations with respect to retail and non-retail clients.\n        Issuers and intermediaries suffer from serious information\n   182. See discussion supra Part I.G.\n   183. Seesupranotes 116-121.\n   184. See discussion supra Part I.C.\n   185. See discussion supra Part II.C.2.\n\n\n2012]                TRANSATLANTIC INVESTOR PROTECTION\nasymmetries regarding product risks and characteristics. Intermedi-\naries trade in scores of different products with limited time to read\nprospectuses or other reports. Issuers, on the other hand, originate\nfinancial products and will invariably possess more information\nabout risks and characteristics than the intermediaries who merely\ntrade those products. Yet intermediaries alone must make \"best in-\nterests,\" suitability or appropriateness determinations for investors.\nIssuers can mitigate these asymmetries at little cost by providing\nbasic information about what kind of investors should typically be\nable to purchase the products. Although the specific parameters of\nthis obligation are beyond the scope of this Note, imposing some\nkind of meaningful obligation on issuers should be an essential part\nof a harmonized transatlantic investor regime.\nD. Obligationson Investors\n          The EU imposes obligations on investors through its elective\nprofessional client regime whereas the United States does not. Inves-\ntor obligations address the information asymmetry between investors\nand intermediaries: although investors may need professional guid-\nance, those investors-especially sophisticated investors-still know\ntheir own financial situations and objectives better than anyone else.\nIn light of this asymmetry, the United States should adopt MiFID's\nelective professional client regime.\" 6 This would not only harmo-\nnize the two regimes but would also maintain protections for retail\nclients while preserving broker-dealer business practices.\n          The obligation on investors to initiate re-classification and to\nprovide accurate information is a necessary part of the client classifi-\ncation scheme and must be adopted by the United States in order to\nachieve meaningful harmonization. Retail clients who want to retain\nmaximum protection would choose not to opt up but would not be\nable to access certain products or services;187 experienced retail cli-\nents who wish to opt up could gain access to the full menu of services\nand products that intermediaries can provide, including all services\ntypically provided by broker-dealers.\n          However, the two regimes should consider plugging a loop-\nhole inherent in MiFID's elective professional client system. Once\nan elective professional client has been classified as such, MiFID ob-\n   186.   See discussion supra Part I.F.\n    187. These clients may not be able to access services that are incompatible with the\nfiduciary duty. See discussion supra Part I.C. 1.\n\n\n               COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNA TIONAL LAW                        [50:490\nligates her to inform the intermediary should she wish to be re-\nclassified, either with respect to a certain product or in general.188\nThe intermediary is under no duty to investigate the client's risk ap-\npetite or financial situation, even if the investor wishes to obtain\nproducts or services that are riskier than those she originally sought\nas an elective professional client.189 The two regimes should consider\nplugging this loophole by imposing a duty to investigate on interme-\ndiaries when the investor seeks to participate in a materially different\nkind of product or service. This adjustment would maintain the flex-\nibility of the elective professional client regime while avoiding situa-\ntions in which those clients invest in products they do not understand.\nCONCLUSION\n         The uniform fiduciary standard takes one step forward by de-\ncreasing investor confusion and eliminating regulatory arbitrage. At\nthe same time, it takes two steps backward by decreasing harmony\nwith the EU and by threatening legitimate broker-dealer business\npractices, resulting in decreased liquidity, increased investor costs\nand decreased investor choice. A harmonized transatlantic investor\nprotection regime could avoid the pitfalls of the uniform fiduciary\nstandard while adding the benefits of cross-border harmonization.\nThis standard should be customer classification-based, aligning fidu-\nciary duties with discretionary, fee-based accounts and less stringent\nduties with non-discretionary, transaction-based accounts. Finally,\nthe harmonized regime should impose obligations on issuers to pro-\nvide product classification information to intermediaries and adopt a\nmodified version of MiFID's elective professional client regime.\nAdopting this harmonized transatlantic protection standard would\nyield results that everyone could agree upon: more liquidity, in-\ncreased cross-border investment services competition, decreased in-\nvestor costs and increased investor choice.\n                                                               Graham Ravdin*\n   188.
